Analysis, notes, resources, and theories about the unsolved Voynich Manuscript
----
Background
----
"The Voynich manuscript is an illustrated codex hand-written in an unknown script referred to as 'Voynichese'.[18] The vellum on which it is written has been carbon-dated to the early 15th century (1404–1438). Stylistic analysis indicates it may have been composed in Italy during the Italian Renaissance.[1][2] The origins, authorship, and purpose of the manuscript are debated. Hypotheses suggest that it is a script for a natural language or constructed language; an unread code, cypher, or other form of cryptography; or a meaningless hoax."

Approaches

Since there are many different theories, a list of some of the many theories will be analyzed. A comprehensive analysis would be needed, as several languages are used as substitution ciphers.

Some of the theories.

One person suggests the alphabet is "Bulgarian cirilic[cyrillic]":

"Voynich alphabet is Bulgarian, cirilic based.V.M.language is Middle Bulgarian hybrid. Hybrid part is Ottoman Turkish.Words shtovam,dyadov,harachi,yanyavar,spanak,varyavar can not be disputed. Who is going to be first to locate and confirm my findings. To help you out 8=V,9=E,2=R,C=S,X=H,4=SHT.The rest of the alphabet I am unable to type on this device. Thank you for your kind consideration. Sahbaz Bajrektarevic, peace."

Another, suggests it uses a pre-800 AD form of encoding"

Thank you for posting Mary’s clearly written book. Having excelled in cryptanalytics in the late 1950s , and freshly decoding Fibonacci’s 1292 AD ‘”Liber Abacl” 15 years ago, thanks to L.E Sigler, several number based attack approaches come to mind,:

First, infinite series problems were written by Fibonacci in finite arithmetic to
2-term and 3-term unit fraction series by subtracting LCM 1/m from n/p considered :

(n/p – 1/m) = (mn – p)/mn

1. 2-term series (mn – p) = 1

Example ( 3/11 – 1/4) = (12 – 11)/44 meant 3/11 = 1/4 + 1/44

2/ 3-term series subtracted a second LCM m

Example

(4/13 – 1/4) = (16 – 13)/52 = (3/52 – 1/18) = (54 – 52)/((18)(52)) = 1/468 meant

4/13 = 1/4 + 1/18 + 1/468

Encoding systems of this type date to 2050 BCE Egypt that scaled n/p by LCM m in a multiplication context such that

n/p x (m/m) = mn/mp

Found the Best divisors of mp that summed to mn …

created 2-term, 3-term, 4-term , and 5-term unit fraction series

Further encoding each numeral into Greek letters , Ionian or Doric, until 800 AD when Arabs ended the ciphered numeral step, and mentored Fibonacci to only write 2-term and 3-term series using numerals imported from India.

Bacon, Dee and other great medieval scholars, cryptographers , would have been aware of the older ciphered numeral to any available set of alphabetic characters … and used it to encode numeric data …hence minimal or virtually no actual language data may.be reported .

That is , only inventories may be reported, a type of message that also has been proven to be very difficult to break.

from Wikipedia:
" The first confirmed owner was Georg Baresch, a 17th-century alchemist from Prague. Baresch was apparently puzzled about this "Sphynx" that had been "taking up space uselessly in his library" for many years.[9] He learned that Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher from the Collegio Romano had published a Coptic (Egyptian) dictionary and claimed to have deciphered the Egyptian hieroglyphs; Baresch twice sent a sample copy of the script to Kircher in Rome, asking for clues. The 1639 letter from Baresch to Kircher is the earliest known mention of the manuscript to have been confirmed.[16]"

"In February this year, a paper published in the journal of the American Botanical Council said one of the plant drawings suggested a possible Mexican origin for the manuscript."

"He said he had managed to find the word for Taurus, alongside a picture of seven stars (seen as part of the zodiac constellation of Taurus) and the word Kantairon alongside a picture of the herb Centaury."

"Now, Bedfordshire University's Stephen Bax says he has deciphered 10 words, which could lead to more discoveries."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#Ciphers :
However, the presence of many tightly grouped shapes in the Voynich manuscript (such as "or", "ar", "ol", "al", "an", "ain", "aiin", "air", "aiir", "am", "ee", "eee", among others) does suggest that its cipher system may make use of a "verbose cipher", where single letters in a plaintext get enciphered into groups of fake letters. For example, the first two lines of page f15v (seen above) contain "oror or" and "or or oro r", which strongly resemble how Roman numerals such as "CCC" or "XXXX" would look if verbosely enciphered.[70]

The Catalan Wikipedia page for the Voynich Manuscript (translated using Google Translate)

"Statistical patterns 
The text consists of more than 170,000 characters, [20] with spaces dividing the text into approximately 35,000 groups of variable length, usually referred to as "words" or "words of words" (37,919); 8,114 of these words are considered unique "word types" . [21] The structure of these words seems to follow certain phonological or orthographic laws  ; for example, certain characters must appear in every word (like English vowels ), some characters never follow others, or some can be doubled or tripled, but others cannot.

The distribution of letters within words is also quite peculiar: some characters only occur at the beginning of a word, some only at the end, and some always in the middle section. [22] Professor Gonzalo Rubio, an expert on ancient languages ​​at Pennsylvania State University , stated: "the things we know as 'grammatical markers': things that usually occur at the beginning or end of words, such as 's "or" d "in our language, and which are used to express grammar, will never appear in the middle of "words" in the Voynich manuscript. This is unheard of for any Indo-European, Hungarian or Finnish language." [23] Many researchers have commented on the very regular structure of the words. [24]

The distribution of letters within the text is also strange. Stephan Vonfelt studied some statistical properties of the distribution of letters and their correlations (properties that can be loosely characterized as rhythmic resonance, alliteration, or assonance) and found that, in this sense, Voynichese is more similar to Chinese than to European languages, although the numerical differences between the Voynichès and the Chinese seem greater than those between the Chinese and European languages. [25]

Almost no word has fewer than two letters or more than ten. [20] Some words occur only in certain sections or on only a few pages; others occur throughout the manuscript. There are few repetitions among the thousand or more labels attached to the illustrations. There are cases where the same common word appears up to three times in a row [20] (see Zipf's law ). Words that differ by only one letter also repeat with unusual frequency, causing single-substitution alphabet decipherments to produce gibberish-like text"

"In 2014, a team led by Dr. Diego Amancio, from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Computing at the University of São Paulo, goespublish a paper detailing a study using statistical methods to analyze word relationships in text. Instead of trying to find meaning, Amancio's team used complex network modeling to look for connections and groups of words. Using concepts such as frequency and intermittency, which measure the occurrence and concentration of a term in the text, Amancio was able to discover the key words in the manuscript and create three-dimensional models of the text's structure and the frequencies of the words Their conclusion was that in 90% of cases, the Voynich systems are similar to those of other known books such as the Bible, indicating that the book is a real piece of text in a real language, and it's not good planned gibberish.

My Analysis
---

My first thought, after reading some of these ideas, was that to read the complete page on the Wikipedia entry on the Voynich Manuscript is to read all the 61 language pages it has been translated in, and hope that there is some information inferred or not incldued inthe other translations. That is, a computer AI did not automtically translate the 61 pages- those were coplted by Wikipedia volutneers. This is just the start of a resource, and ertainly there are many other places to begin, but it reflects more on the reader's biases to think only one language will have a better understanding. 

Thusm my theory is, what if the author of the Voynich Manuscript wanted to include other languages to intentionally require translators to understand other languages and not give preference to any specific one?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel#Themes

"The Tower of Babel (Hebrew: מִגְדַּל בָּבֶל‎, Mīgdal Bāḇel) narrative in Genesis 11:1–9 is an origin myth and parable meant to explain why the world's peoples speak different languages.[1][2][3][4]"
Themes
The story's theme of competition between God and humans appears elsewhere in Genesis, in the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.[13] The 1st-century Jewish interpretation found in Flavius Josephus explains the construction of the tower as a hubristic act of defiance against God ordered by the arrogant tyrant Nimrod. There have, however, been some contemporary challenges to this classical interpretation, with emphasis placed on the explicit motive of cultural and linguistic homogeneity mentioned in the narrative (v. 1, 4, 6).[14] This reading of the text sees God's actions not as a punishment for pride, but as an etiology of cultural differences, presenting Babel as the cradle of civilization."


I think that, if there was a need to encrypt a script (as it would be unlikely a language would use so many unique characters natively), it wold arise out of the need to hide a potentially persecutable belief, which could be an early religion, such as Judaism or Gnosticism.

If a language were banned, it would be a clear target. If a language was not banned, it would not have much of a threat in its era, at least. By writing a hard-to-decipher script, some possible value could be ascribed to it until a supposed Inquisitorial body could determine its affiliation. That is the pessimisstic view. 

The mundane view is that it is is a doodle notebook of a botanist who had an eye for natural biological architecture, which does not preclude the ability to have an interest in cipher/cryptography.

This was the Rennaissance, after all, when well-rounded scholars such as Leonardo Da Vinci were considered doctors, inventors, philosophers, things that could not be claimed with even a PhD and post-doc. The thesis approval process back then was non-existent, yet did not prevent great thinkers from influencing successful businessmen years ater. 

The Codex Leicester, for example, was purchased by Bill Gates in 1994, for $30.8 million (and is now worth $130 million). https://www.businessinsider.com/look-inside-the-codex-leicester-which-bill-gates-bought-for-30-million-2015-7#:~:text=In%201994%2C%20he%20purchased%20Leonardo,to%20select%20museums%20this%20summer.

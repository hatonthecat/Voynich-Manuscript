# Voynich-Manuscript-(also a new claim it is the Silenen Codex)- see 3/28 10pm entry
Analysis, notes, resources, and theories about the unsolved Voynich Manuscript
----
Background
----
"The Voynich manuscript is an illustrated codex hand-written in an unknown script referred to as 'Voynichese'.[18] The vellum on which it is written has been carbon-dated to the early 15th century (1404–1438). Stylistic analysis indicates it may have been composed in Italy during the Italian Renaissance.[1][2] The origins, authorship, and purpose of the manuscript are debated. Hypotheses suggest that it is a script for a natural language or constructed language; an unread code, cypher, or other form of cryptography; or a meaningless hoax."

Approaches

Since there are many different theories, a list of some of the many theories will be analyzed. A comprehensive analysis would be needed, as several languages are used as substitution ciphers.

Some of the theories.

One person suggests the alphabet is "Bulgarian cirilic[cyrillic]":

"Voynich alphabet is Bulgarian, cirilic based.V.M.language is Middle Bulgarian hybrid. Hybrid part is Ottoman Turkish.Words shtovam,dyadov,harachi,yanyavar,spanak,varyavar can not be disputed. Who is going to be first to locate and confirm my findings. To help you out 8=V,9=E,2=R,C=S,X=H,4=SHT.The rest of the alphabet I am unable to type on this device. Thank you for your kind consideration. Sahbaz Bajrektarevic, peace."

Thank you for posting Mary’s clearly written book. Having excelled in cryptanalytics in the late 1950s , and freshly decoding Fibonacci’s 1292 AD ‘”Liber Abacl” 15 years ago, thanks to L.E Sigler, several number based attack approaches come to mind,:

First, infinite series problems were written by Fibonacci in finite arithmetic to
2-term and 3-term unit fraction series by subtracting LCM 1/m from n/p considered :

(n/p – 1/m) = (mn – p)/mn

1. 2-term series (mn – p) = 1

Example ( 3/11 – 1/4) = (12 – 11)/44 meant 3/11 = 1/4 + 1/44

2/ 3-term series subtracted a second LCM m

Example

(4/13 – 1/4) = (16 – 13)/52 = (3/52 – 1/18) = (54 – 52)/((18)(52)) = 1/468 meant

4/13 = 1/4 + 1/18 + 1/468

Encoding systems of this type date to 2050 BCE Egypt that scaled n/p by LCM m in a multiplication context such that

n/p x (m/m) = mn/mp

Found the Best divisors of mp that summed to mn …

created 2-term, 3-term, 4-term , and 5-term unit fraction series

Further encoding each numeral into Greek letters , Ionian or Doric, until 800 AD when Arabs ended the ciphered numeral step, and mentored Fibonacci to only write 2-term and 3-term series using numerals imported from India.

Bacon, Dee and other great medieval scholars, cryptographers , would have been aware of the older ciphered numeral to any available set of alphabetic characters … and used it to encode numeric data …hence minimal or virtually no actual language data may.be reported .

That is , only inventories may be reported, a type of message that also has been proven to be very difficult to break.

from Wikipedia:
" The first confirmed owner was Georg Baresch, a 17th-century alchemist from Prague. Baresch was apparently puzzled about this "Sphynx" that had been "taking up space uselessly in his library" for many years.[9] He learned that Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher from the Collegio Romano had published a Coptic (Egyptian) dictionary and claimed to have deciphered the Egyptian hieroglyphs; Baresch twice sent a sample copy of the script to Kircher in Rome, asking for clues. The 1639 letter from Baresch to Kircher is the earliest known mention of the manuscript to have been confirmed.[16]"

"In February this year, a paper published in the journal of the American Botanical Council said one of the plant drawings suggested a possible Mexican origin for the manuscript."

"He said he had managed to find the word for Taurus, alongside a picture of seven stars (seen as part of the zodiac constellation of Taurus) and the word Kantairon alongside a picture of the herb Centaury."

"Now, Bedfordshire University's Stephen Bax says he has deciphered 10 words, which could lead to more discoveries."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#Ciphers :
However, the presence of many tightly grouped shapes in the Voynich manuscript (such as "or", "ar", "ol", "al", "an", "ain", "aiin", "air", "aiir", "am", "ee", "eee", among others) does suggest that its cipher system may make use of a "verbose cipher", where single letters in a plaintext get enciphered into groups of fake letters. For example, the first two lines of page f15v (seen above) contain "oror or" and "or or oro r", which strongly resemble how Roman numerals such as "CCC" or "XXXX" would look if verbosely enciphered.[70]

The Catalan Wikipedia page for the Voynich Manuscript (translated using Google Translate)

"Statistical patterns 
The text consists of more than 170,000 characters, [20] with spaces dividing the text into approximately 35,000 groups of variable length, usually referred to as "words" or "words of words" (37,919); 8,114 of these words are considered unique "word types" . [21] The structure of these words seems to follow certain phonological or orthographic laws  ; for example, certain characters must appear in every word (like English vowels ), some characters never follow others, or some can be doubled or tripled, but others cannot.

The distribution of letters within words is also quite peculiar: some characters only occur at the beginning of a word, some only at the end, and some always in the middle section. [22] Professor Gonzalo Rubio, an expert on ancient languages ​​at Pennsylvania State University , stated: "the things we know as 'grammatical markers': things that usually occur at the beginning or end of words, such as 's "or" d "in our language, and which are used to express grammar, will never appear in the middle of "words" in the Voynich manuscript. This is unheard of for any Indo-European, Hungarian or Finnish language." [23] Many researchers have commented on the very regular structure of the words. [24]

The distribution of letters within the text is also strange. Stephan Vonfelt studied some statistical properties of the distribution of letters and their correlations (properties that can be loosely characterized as rhythmic resonance, alliteration, or assonance) and found that, in this sense, Voynichese is more similar to Chinese than to European languages, although the numerical differences between the Voynichès and the Chinese seem greater than those between the Chinese and European languages. [25]

Almost no word has fewer than two letters or more than ten. [20] Some words occur only in certain sections or on only a few pages; others occur throughout the manuscript. There are few repetitions among the thousand or more labels attached to the illustrations. There are cases where the same common word appears up to three times in a row [20] (see Zipf's law ). Words that differ by only one letter also repeat with unusual frequency, causing single-substitution alphabet decipherments to produce gibberish-like text"

"In 2014, a team led by Dr. Diego Amancio, from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Computing at the University of São Paulo, goespublish a paper detailing a study using statistical methods to analyze word relationships in text. Instead of trying to find meaning, Amancio's team used complex network modeling to look for connections and groups of words. Using concepts such as frequency and intermittency, which measure the occurrence and concentration of a term in the text, Amancio was able to discover the key words in the manuscript and create three-dimensional models of the text's structure and the frequencies of the words Their conclusion was that in 90% of cases, the Voynich systems are similar to those of other known books such as the Bible, indicating that the book is a real piece of text in a real language, and it's not good planned gibberish. [58]'

My Analysis
---

My first thought, after reading some of these ideas, was that to read the complete page on the Wikipedia entry on the Voynich Manuscript is to read all the 61 language pages it has been translated in, and hope that there is some information inferred or not incldued inthe other translations. That is, a computer AI did not automtically translate the 61 pages- those were coplted by Wikipedia volutneers. This is just the start of a resource, and ertainly there are many other places to begin, but it reflects more on the reader's biases to think only one language will have a better understanding. 

Thusm my theory is, what if the author of the Voynich Manuscript wanted to include other languages to intentionally require translators to understand other languages and not give preference to any specific one?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel#Themes

"The Tower of Babel (Hebrew: מִגְדַּל בָּבֶל‎, Mīgdal Bāḇel) narrative in Genesis 11:1–9 is an origin myth and parable meant to explain why the world's peoples speak different languages.[1][2][3][4]"
Themes
The story's theme of competition between God and humans appears elsewhere in Genesis, in the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.[13] The 1st-century Jewish interpretation found in Flavius Josephus explains the construction of the tower as a hubristic act of defiance against God ordered by the arrogant tyrant Nimrod. There have, however, been some contemporary challenges to this classical interpretation, with emphasis placed on the explicit motive of cultural and linguistic homogeneity mentioned in the narrative (v. 1, 4, 6).[14] This reading of the text sees God's actions not as a punishment for pride, but as an etiology of cultural differences, presenting Babel as the cradle of civilization."


I think that, if there was a need to encrypt a script (as it would be unlikely a language would use so many unique characters natively), it wold arise out of the need to hide a potentially persecutable belief, which could be an early religion, such as Judaism or Gnosticism.

If a language were banned, it would be a clear target. If a language was not banned, it would not have much of a threat in its era, at least. By writing a hard-to-decipher script, some possible value could be ascribed to it until a supposed Inquisitorial body could determine its affiliation. That is the pessimisstic view. 

The mundane view is that it is is a doodle notebook of a botanist who had an eye for natural biological architecture, which does not preclude the ability to have an interest in cipher/cryptography.

This was the Rennaissance, after all, when well-rounded scholars such as Leonardo Da Vinci were considered doctors, inventors, philosophers, things that could not be claimed with even a PhD and post-doc. The thesis approval process back then was non-existent, yet did not prevent great thinkers from influencing successful businessmen years ater. 

The Codex Leicester, for example, was purchased by Bill Gates in 1994, for $30.8 million (and is now worth $130 million). https://www.businessinsider.com/look-inside-the-codex-leicester-which-bill-gates-bought-for-30-million-2015-7#:~:text=In%201994%2C%20he%20purchased%20Leonardo,to%20select%20museums%20this%20summer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85YcMMhvvoQ (Though in many ways is worth more than that)

Good presentation https://github.com/joaoperfig/voynichstudies/blob/master/voynich.pdf : 

"There is not a single instance of a word being erased or corrected
(which suggests the book might be a copy) but some words have
been retouched"

This doesn't mean that a copy is a forgery, but rather that whoever wanted a copy - perhaps a king wanted an original, but the original was in such bad shape, or that there was something encoded in the original that he did not want left in. I prefer to start with the least plausible, so it should be relatively simple to examine more plausible reasons for making a copy. Photocopy machines didn't exist then, so would it be out of the ordinary to have no corrections? perhaps a wealthy buyer did not want any errors, and required his scribes to rewrite any pages that contained errors. Its not as if the pages had to be bounded before they were written.

Forgery Theory
---

"One of the most common tropes in the history of forgery is that of a rare book dealer "discovering" previously unknown manuscripts. Voynich is known to have had just this "magic" touch. He is also said to have acquired a supply of vellum and to have used his knowledge of chemistry gained at the University of Moscow to replicate medieval inks and pigments. "

"But until forensic tests are done on the ink and pigments - so far, only the vellum has been carbon dated to the 15th Century - the riddle of this mysterious book will continue to exert a powerful magnetic pull on present and future Voynichologists."

Other thoughts:
--
To take a contrarian view, what suggestion is there that the manuscript must have any meaning? There could be multiple reasons why the manuscript cannot be decoded with just one language, or at all. Since the story of Babel is in Genesis, which is in the Old Testament (everything I learned from the Old Testament I learned from Lewis Black: https://www.facebook.com/beststandupcomedy/videos/658478987635564/ at 2:30), what if the inability to decode it is due to the unwillingness for different languages to cooperate? Short of holding hands and singing Kumbaya around the Tower of Babel, the Man in the Sky may not have wanted to signal any help in decoding this manuscript. Thus, this puzzle is like a punishment for those who spent their entire lives having never decoded it, unless everyone trying to decode it is doing something wrong (something other than trying to decode it, assuming it is not a fatal knowledge). One article suggests it is the "venus flytrap" of brilliant minds. I would think that, the original author could not have foreseen that it would take so long to decode because he or she lived in a completely different time, but one where different types of knowledge were not dismissed. Perhaps, it is our willfull ignorance in ancient ways of thought that would constrain the ability to contextualize the meaning. In many ways, the Rennaissance appears more of a utopia compared to the present. Perhaps not in medical technology, but in many other cultural ways.

Much Ado about Botany
--

Maybe no one is right if a higher order planted the truth in every language, so as not to give preference to any language, unless they all cooperated. An academic, and empath wouldn't need to believe in the same religion to understand why this manuscript was written, not is that relgion necessarily knowable, but to consider the context of the era, the manuscript could have been written to hide from heresy, but if it was the last in a language, then it might have been a translation attempt, or some pagan text. That said, it is not possible to rule out any particular subject, despite the obvious botanical and pharmacopeiac illustrations. I call it Much ado about Botany.

I wonder why some think it was written by Roger Bacon- the paper appears too "new" to have been from 1200s (but it's not much newer if it carbon dating suggests the 1400s). Another idea is, the original might not have had all the doodlings- what if the original author wrote mainly the text, but other artisans added more drawings later on? This wouldn't be unprecedented- large churches were built for continuous expansion- they were not built with one vision in mind- a new wind here, a new bell and tower later on- nothing suggests the book had to be written in one sitting- that said, it could have been continued by just a handful, as the scribes have been estimated to be 6 or less. It would be interesting if it were a book from Norse travels from NewFoundland (which could have taken tales all the way from South America) but I think that far less likely. Perhaps Marco Polo transcribed a phonetic account of a middle-eastern language. Any traveller since then could have too.

There are a lot of interesting theories that many of them can sound very plausible, but also the fact that many centuries have added to the obfuscatory nature of the any hidden etchings and re-transcribings adds to the complexity.

I find the fact that some words were found in High German from the early 13th century interesting (https://web.archive.org/web/20111018025101/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf), but also some parallels that are not particularly related but interesting nonetheless:

"Kalush and Sloman posit that the only reason Houdini would abruptly leave the United States in 1900, when he had finally achieved notoriety—and a paycheck equivalent to $45,000 a week—was because he was engaged in espionage. Houdini was rumored to be providing the German police with information about wanted criminals, as well as unspecified information to Scotland Yard Superintendent William Melville, monitoring anarchists in Russia, and helping the U.S. Secret Service with their anti-counterfeiting mission." from: https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/was-houdini-a-spy/

Melville also worked with Schlomo Rosenblum (Sidney Reilly): 

"In the next ten years, Melville embarked on a large series of well-publicized raids against anarchists. He went to Victoria Station to personally arrest bomber Théodule Meunier.[1] In 1896 Melville recruited Shlomo Rosenblum (later known as Sidney Reilly) as an informer in an organization he suspected to be involved with Russian anarchists.[1]" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Melville

Reilly was aquainted with Ethel Voynich, who was Wilfrid Voynich's last wife (from 1902-1930); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Reilly#The_Gadfly

Granted, anti-counterfeiting was probably a standard job duty of the Scotland Yard and something a bookseller like Wilfrid Voynich needed to be acquainted with to ensure he wasn't purchasing a fake manuscript, but whether or not the availability of 500-year old blank parchment paper would be plausible is certainly extraordinary but not impossible, thus a rare opportunity to fabricate text with gibberish (or at least a convenient way to delay decoding of a cipher by including alongside other ancient texts on a shelf). That said, the ink would also need to have been carbon dated that far back (presumably also a rare case of having been stored in a container for 500 years without evaporating).

from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#Early_history: 

"Marci's 1665/1666 cover letter to Kircher says that, according to his friend the late Raphael Mnishovsky, the book had once been bought by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia for 600 ducats (66.42 troy ounce actual gold weight, or 2.07 kg). (Mnishovsky had died in 1644, more than 20 years earlier, and the deal must have occurred before Rudolf's abdication in 1611, at least 55 years before Marci's letter. However, Karl Widemann sold books to Rudolf II in March 1599.)

Wellcome Library, oil
Ernest Board's portrayal of Bacon in his observatory at Merton College
According to the letter, Mnishovsky (but not necessarily Rudolf) speculated that the author was 13th-century Franciscan friar and polymath Roger Bacon.[6] Marci said that he was suspending judgment about this claim, but it was taken quite seriously by Wilfrid Voynich, who did his best to confirm it.[16] Voynich contemplated the possibility that the author was Albertus Magnus if not Roger Bacon.[63]


Mathematician John Dee may have sold the manuscript to Emperor Rudolf around 1600.
The assumption that Bacon was the author led Voynich to conclude that John Dee sold the manuscript to Rudolf. Dee was a mathematician and astrologer at the court of Queen Elizabeth I of England who was known to have owned a large collection of Bacon's manuscripts.


Edward Kelley might have created the manuscript as a fraud
Dee and his scrier (spirit medium) Edward Kelley lived in Bohemia for several years, where they had hoped to sell their services to the emperor. However, this sale seems quite unlikely, according to John Schuster, because Dee's meticulously kept diaries do not mention it.[16]

If Bacon did not create the Voynich manuscript, a supposed connection to Dee is much weakened. It was thought possible, prior to the carbon dating of the manuscript, that Dee or Kelley might have written it and spread the rumor that it was originally a work of Bacon's in the hopes of later selling it.[64]: 249 

Fabrication by Voynich
Some suspect Voynich of having fabricated the manuscript himself.[7] As an antique book dealer, he probably had the necessary knowledge and means, and a lost book by Roger Bacon would have been worth a fortune. Furthermore, Baresch's letter and Marci's letter only establish the existence of a manuscript, not that the Voynich manuscript is the same one mentioned. These letters could possibly have been the motivation for Voynich to fabricate the manuscript, assuming that he was aware of them. However, many consider the expert internal dating of the manuscript and the June 1999[52] discovery of Baresch's letter to Kircher as having eliminated this possibility.[7][16]

Eamon Duffy says that the radiocarbon dating of the parchment (or, more accurately, vellum) "effectively rules out any possibility that the manuscript is a post-medieval forgery", as the consistency of the pages indicates origin from a single source, and "it is inconceivable" that a quantity of unused parchment comprising "at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins" could have survived from the early 15th century.[27]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee

"Dee eventually left Elizabeth's service and went on a quest for additional knowledge in the deeper realms of the occult and supernatural. He aligned himself with several individuals who may have been charlatans, travelled through Europe and was accused of spying for the English crown. Upon his return to England, he found his home and library vandalised. He eventually returned to the Queen's service, but was turned away when she was succeeded by James I.
In 1583, Dee met the impoverished yet popular Polish nobleman Albert Łaski, who, after overstaying his welcome at court, invited Dee to accompany him back to Poland.[19] With some prompting by the "angels" (again through Kelley) and by dint of his worsening status at court, Dee decided to do so. He, Kelley and their families left in September 1583, but Łaski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country.[34] Dee and Kelley began a nomadic life in Central Europe, meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences, which Dee detailed in his diaries and almanacs.[32][33] They had audiences with Emperor Rudolf II in Prague Castle and King Stephen Báthory of Poland, whom they attempted to convince of the importance of angelic communication. The Bathory meeting took place at the Niepołomice Castle (near Kraków, then capital of Poland) and was later analysed by Polish historians (Ryszard Zieliński, Roman Żelewski, Roman Bugaj) and writers (Waldemar Łysiak).[citation needed] While Dee was generally seen as a man of deep knowledge, he was mistrusted for his connection with the English monarch, Elizabeth I, for whom some thought (and still do) that Dee was a spy." 

Ok, so it is known that John Dee associated himself with charlatans, and Voynich believed Dee sold it to Rudolf. That doesn't mean Dee sold Rudolf a forgery, nor would Voynich be interested in purchasing a forgery (had he somehow concluded that and that the manuscript still had value), but he was interested enough that ciphers were one of his other posession: :

"Voynich relocated his London bookshop to 175 Piccadilly in 1917.[12] Also in 1917, based on rumors, Voynich was investigated by the FBI, in relation to his possession of Bacon's cipher. The report also noted that he dealt with manuscripts from the 13th, 12th, and 11th centuries, and that the value of his books at the time was half a million dollars. However, the investigation did not reveal anything significant beyond the fact that he possessed a secret code nearly a thousand years old.[4]"

https://www.colinmackinnon.com/attachments/The_US_BOI_File_on_Voynich_p.pdf <-[4] As for "thousand", Francis Bacon developed the cipher in 1605 (400 years prior), so it is unclear whether the 57 page report refers to an earlier cipher, or that is incorrect. Unless it implies that he was merely not in posesssion of the "newer" Bacon cipher.

Book stores and antique stores are not all above selling counterfeits, at least in popular portrayal: 

"And then we learn that some of these antiques are more like "antiques." We never know how many of Childan's antiques are actually clever forgeries, which definitely connects these antiques to issues of deceit and uncertainty. Add to that the fact that some of these fakes are made by "Frank Frink," who is himself kind of a fake, since he changed his name and nose to survive. (It's like the paper writes itself.)

Now, Childan doesn't know about his "antiques," but Wyndam-Matson clearly knows, since many of them come from his store. W-M has his own idea about authenticity and historicity, which is that it's all in the eye of the beholder. So for him, fakes are as real as authentic antiques as long as the person thinks it's real."

Which isn't to say anything about legitimate stores, but definitely an exploitable trade.

5:23PM - A Matter of Two Bacons
---

Update: After reading 1/2way through I found the answer:

The BOI report is fascinating- Voynich's mention of a Bacon cipher briefly got mixed up for Francis Bacon's cipher, when the mentions in other documents that Voynich was unambiguously referring to Roger Bacon (p.15):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76194453/228381484-e248ee16-3c55-4551-a4b6-a96d724e9d9d.png)

On p. 22, The BOI leter further adds: "If he thought he could be of any service to the Department, it was only because it appears to be an excellent cipher, in as much as it has for several years defied the efforts of experts to decipher it, and he thought it might be, as it undoubtedly would, of value to the War Department to posess so valuable a system, but obviously it can not be placed at the disposal of the Government until we succeed in ascertaining what the system is.

If Mr. Voynich said that he was acquainted wiht the army cipher, he said nothing more than any non-military man could have said who had read the published statements to the effect that the army was using the cipher disc[overy?]. This has been a matter of common knowledge for many years)."

This does make me wonder, for someone who was able to acquire many manuscripts, that German castles weren't exactly garage sales like in the U.S., thus the availability of certain rare texts could have been made available through less honest and surreptitious means-visting estates, pretending to be distant family, etc.

About those "garage sales"

https://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesEurope/EasternPoland_Voynich01.htm

"Wilfrid was a regular visitor to the Continent, in particular to Italy (during which he became friends with Achille Ratti, at that point a librarian, who would eventually become Pope Pius XI). He was able to buy large quantities of old books and manuscripts, from religious houses and other places, on one occasion persuading the religious in question to take what he considered to be modern tat in exchange for some wonderful old texts. In 1912 he visited the Villa Mondragone, Frascati, at the request of the Jesuits there - who wished to sell some of their books in order to raise funds (this being done, apparently, without the knowledge of their superiors)."

As I suspected, he purchased some heavily discounted texts using questionable practices, then marking them up in the UK and U.S.

"Among the books he acquired as a result of this transaction was a peculiar volume, of some age and obviously written in code, which was to provide him with a more than contemporary notability.

"intellectual vagrant"

An antiquated term, not often used.

https://books.apple.com/us/book/thoreau-beyond-borders/id1546666826

"Henry David Thoreau spent his life as an intellectual vagrant, jumping fences, pushing boundaries, and crossing borders. How, why, and to what end are the questions asked by contributors to this new volume of essays, whose work crosses national and disciplinary borders to think about Thoreau anew."

According to Google N-Gram viewer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ngram_Viewer

The phrase vagrant has decreased but cannot be found often adjacent "intellectual"

Notes, ideas and thoughts on the Silenen Codex:

The lecturer who wrote the article has a PhD, works at a Cistercian theological university, not just any theological university but with a parent organization as the Catholic Church. In the 1400s, when this manuscript is believed to have been written, the Catholic church authorities- the popes and bishops, were considered infallible.

"Because of the complexity in defining infallibility, some Protestant and non-denominational views confuse papal infallibility with impeccability, as if the Pope were immune from sin."

Viewed through the lens of philological analysis, as with scholar-priests such as Lorenzo Valla, the Catholic Church is arguably one of the most non-promotional institutions still in existence:

“Valla is “best known for his historical-critical textual analysis that proved that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery, therefore attacking and undermining the presumption of temporal power claimed by the papacy.[1] Lorenzo is sometimes seen as a precursor of the Reformation.[2][3]”

Only an institution committed to pursuing the truth, regardless of promotion, contradiction is capable of achieving that aim.

Furthermore,

In Centuries after Aristotle, in “Perspectives on Early Modern and Modern Intellectual History (Gates and Marino, 2001), on p.39:

“Erasmus has recourse to Jerome's auctoritas again in rebutting Poggio's other accusation at Valla-that by emending the Vulgate, Valla desecrated the most venerated text of Western Christianity. On this point too, Erasmus is clear and firm. In reality, Valla had completed the task begun by Jerome's, was intended to combat the errors and superficiality of biblical exegesis flawed by insufficient command of Latin and Greek. While Valla brought to bear on the New Testament his linguistic skills and literary erudition, he did not forget that these texts were fundamental for Christianity. Moreover, asserts Erasmus, Valla's research was in conformity with the norms established by the Council of Vienne (1311-12) and later included in the Constitutiones Clementinae. These norms imposed the study of biblical language on the students of theology, in order to secure a correct understanding of the Holy Scriptures.”

"This was the first instance of modern, scientific diplomatics. Independently of both Cusa and Valla, Reginald Pecocke, Bishop of Chichester (1450–57), reached a similar conclusion." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine Though the Donation of Constantine ended up on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, the Index was formally abolished on June 1966 by Pope Paul VI.

Thus, while the Church has not always become more transparent and more self-correcting, the effort by Dr. Bernhart-Königstein can be seen in the same light as Valla and Erasmus, in that it seeks to shed light on the philological mysteries of an era undergoing significant change, not just in Switzerland, but in Valois, Hapsburg and Italian kingdoms.

When I examine the veracity of something, the first thing I look for is, why would someone make something up, when the truth is more interesting than fiction? Not everyone is dishonest, regardless of interest. From p.46 of the Voynich-Silenen Comedy,

“The family, and thus also the Voynich-Silenen manuscript, gained special importance through the founding of the Swiss Guard, whose first captain was the nephew and son of Albin von Silenen's brother, Kaspar von Silenen. At that time, secular and spiritual principalities still formed a unit. In the Confederation and also in Valais, however, the power of the prince-bishop was severely restricted by the state council. In Switzerland, the bourgeoisie had taken power early on.

In diplomatic circles, the Silenen manuscript helped, the memoirs of Jost von Silenen possibly helped as a memorandum in the formation of the Swiss state. But it certainly became the ideological founding document, the charter of the Swiss Guard in the Vatican, whose captain was the nephew of Bishop Kaspar von Silenen. When he dies - a son followed him as captain - it falls into oblivion and is used as an alchemy book by Emperor Rudolf ll. and re-enter history as the Voynich Manuscript, until rediscovered by its readability as the Silenen Manuscript.

In fact, this discovery also contributes something to the history of Switzerland's national hero, Wilhelm Tell, but in a humorous way and with hints, there is no doubt about the intended reference to Tell, as he is perhaps the second great hero of Switzerland that has been underestimated (conditio sine qua non) and as the Creator of this manuscript also personally connected with the legend of Tell.'

If a story is bursting with humor, there is no need to embellish. The truth works for you, rather than the other way around.

Page 53: “III. An almost moral bishop”

In the manuscript, the bishop appears honest, but not impeccable. I think the ability to accurately assess this manuscript requires, at the very least, empathy in in the subject matter. If someone believes honesty is valueless, then they value appearance over substance. The question appears to be, not whether Jost di Silenen had anything to gain from writing this, of which there is important historical value, but what he had to lose in not writing. If he were religious, he may have preferred to write his conscience in the eyes of God, even (or in such a way) if no one else could decode it in his life time. As for the aforementioned memorandum of formation, that too may have been decipherable only to his dynasty.

Another point of context is this particularly unfalsifiable part:

“You can't really say it's written, rather it's designed, maybe sketched, co-organized as a client, because there is no example of this kind of art before him. And yet, as the humanist behind the work, Jost of Silenen himself should be considered. The references are too individual, the continuous connection with the biography is too unusual, the educational path, yes, the origin.

And finally, the work of self-panegyric clearly embodies the philosophy of life and the political mission expected of it. Not so rare in the Renaissance, but also typically Italian, that in diplomats, politicians, even more so in church people, artistic qualities such as Eneas Silvius Piccolomini, Gulio de Medici, would come to mind spontaneously.”

Certainly the illustrations of the Voynich manuscript are unique- not quite high-art, but not quite outsider art either, unless a Bishop's art is categorically considered sub-par. Rather, I think the uniqueness of the Rennaissance era, its foreignness in terms of religious values, pre-industrialization, pre-commercialization are moreso explanations of its “alien-ness” than anything specifically extraordinary to its contemporary era, other than the fact that Switzerland's founding was especially unique- in its supranational character. All this contributes to requiring a very extraordinary understanding of an era far removed from the current, and one that has many lessons that can be learned from. As they say, “it takes one to know one” may be unfair to say here (it is not possible to claim to understand or self-identify with a 500+ year old contemporary era - not even a Ren-Faire attendee could make that claim).

Memoirs have been written since ancient times, says Wikipedia, but how fitting it would be that one founder of the Old Swiss Confederacy would mix personal with state events, being unique. While many claims to unfalsifiable theories can appear impossible to prove, the Dr. Bernhard-Konigstein claims, or should I say teases, with hints that Jost of Silenen is betrayed by minor errors (p.52):

“All the details in the manuscript are important, To correctly interpret his message. There who wrote his fingers sore, But it is proclaimed here as a miracle With what many thousands of variants The same glyphs got mixed up. Even if it were a waste An eternal joke in every turn. But where I read the opaque text, Little by little he betrayed his nature, Also to understand botany I had to go into history.”

“The author was known to us for a long time He is already mentioned as a patron! He left us a breviary It is also historically easy to grasp! Yes, his knowledge of the last things Towers over the Hildegard of Bingen.”


But the doctor's own poem becomes more poetic, which is key to deciphering its origin:


“Yes, the Voynich, may we guess

Is as a picture a secret Morgarten.

Are also text and root in splendor,

They point us to this battle

Because even in the moor from time to time

Even the root likes to stand free.

Even if the soot is without a picture,

Enough of that are in world chronicles.

Every stalk in the global garden

Bears witness to Swiss semispecies.

However, if you are often in a group,

Impaled a flower head."

The “semi-species” is in reference to Switzerland's four national languages- German, French, Italian, and Romansh (Half-Swiss/Half-German, Half-Swiss/Half-French, Half-Swiss,Half Italian, etc), and the flowers petals with 4 heads connected, as well as diverse ethnic makeup, thus the plants with separately colored roots and stems pays homage to Switzerland's historical foundings. How poetic. Just a week ago, I gave a quick look at the many languages in the manuscript- what appeared to be Arabic, Hebrew, Cyrillic, and thought, whoever wrote this might have had a biblical interpretation of languages- something like the Tower of Babel, but there was nothing I could connect to a contemporary event (which isn't to say a real tower of babel once existed in ancient times, but the story itself was metaphorical).

I rate this claim highly inspired by religion, but no less implausible, since religion was the norm back then. In other words- all the more so due to its religious subtexts (glyphs, symbols), can be seen to match its contextual era. It was also, as the author points out, not yet separated from all of the following: stately, secular matters and nature.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#Statistical_patterns

" As noted in Bowern's review, multiple scribes or "hands" may have written the manuscript, possibly using two methods of encoding at least one natural language.[45][46][47][48] The "language" Voynich A appears in the herbal and pharmaceutical parts of the manuscript. The "language" known as Voynich B appears in the balneological section, some parts of the medicinal and herbal sections, and the astrological section. The most common vocabulary items of Voynich A and Voynich B are substantially different. Topic modeling of the manuscript suggests that pages identified as written by a particular scribe may relate to a different topic.[45]" 

Dr. Bernhart-Königstein's claims that it was written by  Jost von Silenen and his family, including his nephew, Kaspar von Silenen, would support the statistical analysis that two/multiple scribes contributed to it (perhaps in two different sections/topics as previously theorized).

What is the difference between a hoax and a comedy? 

Hoax:

"A hoax is a widely publicized falsehood so fashioned as to invite reflexive, unthinking acceptance by the greatest number of people of the most varied social identities and of the highest possible social pretensions to gull its victims into putting up the highest possible social currency in support of the hoax.[1]

Whereas the promoters of frauds, fakes, and scams devise them so that they will withstand the highest degree of scrutiny customary in the affair, hoaxers are confident, justifiably or not, that their representations will receive no scrutiny at all. They have such confidence because their representations belong to a world of notions fundamental to the victims' views of reality, but whose truth and importance they accept without argument or evidence, and so never question.

Some hoaxers intend eventually to unmask their representations as in fact a hoax so as to expose their victims as fools; seeking some form of profit, other hoaxers hope to maintain the hoax indefinitely, so that it is only when sceptical persons willing to investigate their claims publish their findings that at last they stand revealed as hoaxers."

Comedy:

Comedy is a genre of fiction that consists of discourses or works intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, film, stand-up comedy, television, radio, books, or any other entertainment medium. The term originated in ancient Greece: In Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by political satire performed by comic poets in theaters.[1] The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance pitting two groups, ages, genders, or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old".[2] A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions posing obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth then becomes constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to resort to ruses which engender dramatic irony, which provokes laughter.[3]"

That Dr. Bernhart-Königstein chose to name the manuscript a "Comedy" is revealing in itself. It suggests familiarity with the topic, and possibly historical knowledge going as far back as the Ancient Greek definition of Old Comedy.

On p. 47: 

"The family, and thus also the Voynich-Silenen manuscript, gained special importance through
the founding of the Swiss Guard, whose first captain was the nephew and son of Albin von
Silenen's brother, Kaspar von Silenen. At that time, secular and spiritual principalities still
formed a unit. In the Confederation and also in Valais, however, the power of the prince-bishop
was severely restricted by the state council. In Switzerland, the bourgeoisie had taken power
early on.

In diplomatic circles, the Silenen manuscript helped, the memoirs of Jost von Silenen possibly
helped as a memorandum in the formation of the Swiss state. But it certainly became the
ideological founding document, the charter of the Swiss Guard in the Vatican, whose captain was
the nephew of Bishop Kaspar von Silenen. When he dies - a son followed him as captain - it falls
into oblivion and is used as an alchemy book by Emperor Rudolf ll. and re-enter history as the
Voynich Manuscript, until rediscovered by its readability as the Silenen Manuscript.

In fact, this discovery also contributes something to the history of Switzerland's national hero,
Wilhelm Tell, but in a humorous way and with hints, there is no doubt about the intended
reference to Tell, as he is perhaps the second great hero of Switzerland that has been
underestimated (conditio sine qua non) and as the Creator of this manuscript also personally
connected with the legend of Tell.'

The "amusing" aspect is that Jost of Silenen appears to have been a clever negotiator of peace, even though he faced quite a bit of competition.

p.52
"But where I read the opaque text,
Little by little he betrayed his nature,
Also to understand botany
I had to go into history."

p.45

"And we have to turn it up a notch ourselves: in the Silenen Swiss comedy, the people of
Switzerland are given something belatedly that unexpectedly strengthens their identity like it
hasn't since Friedrich Schiller. What came together through battles and demarcations, what was
strengthened by a common tradition and alliances, always threatened to break apart through the
differences in languages, denominations and cultures in the mountains and valleys. What is
astonishing about Swiss patriotism, which runs counter to all European nationalisms, is its
supranational character. This Helvetic construction, which could actually only have come about
in a supranational world of the Middle Ages, seems to have formed a stable community that has
endured and shaped the Alps to this day.

Even if the Sonderbund war has long since been settled, no one should assume that the neutral
cohesion of such a diverse people, especially in today's centralized European Union, does not
require a new, further unifying document at any time. So it would also be a special joy for all
European citizens if such a new document of stability and peace, as the democratic model, had
been found, especially in the most unexpected unpeaceful times in Europe a new message of
peace comes at the right time. History shows that peace can succeed if there are good diplomats
like Jost of Silenen.

Jost of Silenen is little known today, but that could change very quickly. In 1482 he was made
bishop of Sitten in Wallis. He is quite a successful historical figure, politically and also as a
patron of the arts, even if he was deposed as a bishop at the end of his life. But he was even more
successful than we previously knew, namely as a Swiss patriot. Who would have guessed that
500 years later he would be remembered for a very special reason. Apart from his political
commitment, he himself had made a significant contribution to his spiritual monument and its
indicated impact. In the work that we still call the “Voynich Manuscript” for the time being.

p.46

"It was his merit that he negotiated the first enduring peace treaty with Ferdinand of Habsburg,
the so-called Eternal Direction, which guaranteed the Confederation of the time its first
independence and secured the status it had fought for as a free, democratic nation, which was
unique in Europe and which thought ahead to neutrality and so on can also be used for all times
as a model for peace in Europe and indeed in the world. At that time still officially called
Unification, but it was the first peace treaty around 1474 that set this eternal direction and made
peace possible even after the Swabian Wars. The Habsburgs were to give up their territory in
Alsace for a fee and in return receive a promise of support for military service from the
Confederates. Certainly, Charles the Bold's urge to conquer made the parties move closer
together. But there were now peaceful paths between two archenemies who have Not spared
themselves, which brought a lot of suffering to the population. However, it was not only about
territories, but also about civil liberties, which were guaranteed for the first time and at the
crucial moment. So Switzerland had resources free for the Burgundian wars, otherwise
Switzerland might not exist today. The French king Louis XI, who pulls the strings in the
background and was an enemy of Charles the Bold, made Jost of Silenen the bishop of Grenoble
as a thank you until he was appointed to the bishopric of Sion in 1482."

A workhorse, of diplomatic gruntwork. Jost of Silenen would have been powerless, had he not invented a meritable solution for Swiss patriotism. Many of us are familiar with under-appreciated statesmen, such as Richard Holbrooke, who had a post-mortem biographical documentary made by his son, called The Diplomat: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diplomat_(2015_film)

And the undervalue of diplomacy is also highlighted in the humorous Norwegian music video tribute by Yvis - Jan Egeland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn-oemgzlEU

Thus, the joke is on those who do not value peace.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor

"Occam's razor, Ockham's razor, or Ocham's razor (Latin: novacula Occami) in philosophy is the problem-solving principle that recommends searching for explanations constructed with the smallest possible set of elements. It is also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony (Latin: lex parsimoniae). Attributed to William of Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher and theologian, it is frequently cited as Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem, which translates as "Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity",[1][2] although Occam never used these exact words. Popularly, the principle is sometimes inaccurately[3] paraphrased as "The simplest explanation is usually the best one."[4]"

The analysis encourages the reader to consider all the information on page 52:

"All the details in the manuscript are important,
To correctly interpret his message.
There who wrote his fingers sore,
But it is proclaimed here as a miracle
With what many thousands of variants
The same glyphs got mixed up."

Parsimonious and holistic considerations are not mutually exclusive, rather, they are like a Venn Diagram for comparing the explanation of a solar system within a larger, suspected, but yet undetermined (contemporary to the era) galaxy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_knowledge_about_galaxies,_clusters_of_galaxies,_and_large-scale_structure
For example, the concept of heliocentricism, while not directly related to the concept of galaxies, was not apparent in the 1400s, thus geo-centricism would have grouped stars and planets alike. (not distant galaxies have some of their own heliocentricism, which revolve around Earth, or, "as long as they ultimately revolve around earth"- no, it seemed to assume all planets and distant stars orbited around earth, period) 

In other words, the Swiss Bishop theory of authorship is a tiny interpretation, but no less impossible- one that requires at least some inspiration at looking at the stars, even if in a geocentric mentality, to eventually correctly re-orient one's mirror neurons to a different axis, and to be the first to hypothesize heliocentricism. 

By "tiny", I am referring to p.45:

"The references are too individual, the continuous connection with the biography is too unusual, the educational path, yes, the origin."

and (I know some of the quotes are repeated, but) p.46: 

"It was his merit that he negotiated the first enduring peace treaty with Ferdinand of Habsburg,
the so-called Eternal Direction, which guaranteed the Confederation of the time its first
independence and secured the status it had fought for as a free, democratic nation, which was
unique in Europe and which thought ahead to neutrality and so on can also be used for all times
as a model for peace in Europe and indeed in the world."

When one thinks of Europe on a map, it one might first think of the outward, shoreful countries- Spain, France, Italy, and those that jut out, like <i>Jutland</i>. It is often easy to overlook Switzerland- not only because of its uniquess, but its landlocked, and while beautiful mountainous,  difficult terrain. Thus it sometimes paradoxically is more common to overlook something potentially hiding in plain sight- it is not always obvious of course, but as he poetically references Newton- "standing on the shoulders of giants" (p.49), and, that it was sitting not far from Switzerland for much of its life, although, not without incident:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#History
"No records of the book for the next 200 years have been found, but in all likelihood, it was stored with the rest of Kircher's correspondence in the library of the Collegio Romano (now the Pontifical Gregorian University).[16] It probably remained there until the troops of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy captured the city in 1870 and annexed the Papal States. The new Italian government decided to confiscate many properties of the Church, including the library of the Collegio.[16] Many books of the university's library were hastily transferred to the personal libraries of its faculty just before this happened, according to investigations by Xavier Ceccaldi and others, and those books were exempt from confiscation.[16] Kircher's correspondence was among those books, and so, apparently, was the Voynich manuscript, as it still bears the ex libris of Petrus Beckx, head of the Jesuit order and the university's rector at the time.[12][16]

Beckx's private library was moved to the Villa Mondragone, Frascati, a large country palace near Rome that had been bought by the Society of Jesus in 1866 and housed the headquarters of the Jesuits' Ghislieri College.[16]

In 1903, the Society of Jesus (Collegio Romano) was short of money and decided to sell some of its holdings discreetly to the Vatican Library. The sale took place in 1912, but not all of the manuscripts listed for sale ended up going to the Vatican.[62] Wilfrid Voynich acquired 30 of these manuscripts, among them the one which now bears his name.[16] He spent the next seven years attempting to interest scholars in deciphering the script, while he worked to determine the origins of the manuscript.[4]"

Abductive reasoning, Inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, all play a significant role, though not in any order of decreasing importance.

I am reminded of a scene where in Peter Seller's Being there (1979), the president who becomes alerted to the suspicious new character of the gardener, meets with advisors who believe he is working for the FBI or CIA (due to some details such as the clothing he has was made from a garment factory from the 1930s and no longer exists). This kind of post-hoc fallacious reasoning leads many to assume that post-15 century methods of encryption and beliefs could explain the "real" meaning of something which, if its carbon dating is to be believed, and I have every reason to believe that, then it would have to be interepreted from the era it came from, not from high-tech RSA encryption, which wasn't an idea back then. 

p.48
"However, there is no historical chronology, but a regional arrangement. In
this respect, the term chronicle is not entirely appropriate. It is the bishop's personal choice, and
often more present than thought of retrospectively, the deciphered text tells us."

Some interesting background:

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazze 

"The matzah is an object and the popular uprising named after it, which was triggered in a ritualized form in medieval Valais .

The object of matzah was usually a wooden trunk with a carved human face with grotesque features.

The seizure of the matzah was the beginning of a popular uprising. It went something like this: the matzah was usually hung on a tree in a village square overnight. The following morning the residents gathered and waited for an initiate to seize the matzah and carry it away. The people followed this man, the matzah master, until he put the matzah on the ground. The residents gathered around the matzah and began to ask her questions such as: "Mazzah, what do you want?", "Mazzah, what is wrong with you?" etc. The matzah, of course, remained silent, whereupon the people demanded a lawyer for the matzah . An eloquent initiate offered himself as advocate to the crowd and also began questioning the matzah. To make it exciting, he first asked trivial questions, whereupon the matzah master shook the matzah in the negative, until after some time, in a heated mood, the lawyer made the right assumptions and accusations. The matzah master now performed a wild, joyful dance with the matzah. The lawyer turned to the people and shouted: "You have heard the complaints of the matzah, now discuss what to do!" So the conspiracy began, everyone present who agreed with the decisions drove a nail into the matzah .

The best-known case of the matzah seizure in Valais history took place in 1496, when the pro-France and therefore unpopular bishop Jost von Silenen was relieved of his office by the rebellious people and chased out of the country within a few days, which, after a brief interlude by his uncle Nicolaus Schiner, made him the declared France enemy Matthäus Schiner came to the bishopric.'

"As a politician, Georg Supersaxo (* around 1450; † 1529 in Vevey ; also Jörg auf der Flüe ) held the various offices of Zehndenmeier of Mörel , Grand Kastlan of Anniviers , provincial clerk of the Valais , secretary of Matthäus Schiner . As head of the Milan party and tribune of the people, he carried the matzah against Jost von Silenen according to customs and developed into the antagonist of his pupil and later bishop Matthäus Schiner." 

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Supersaxo 

"His campaigns in the Val d'Ossola failed, finally the Confederates were defeated by the Duchy of Milan at the Battle of Crevola , which led to a peace in 1495. Without power and reputation and under pressure from Georg Supersaxo , Jost von Silenen withdrew to Lyon and was deposed as bishop by the Pope in 1497; most recently he was titular bishop ofHierapolis . Attempts to recapture him failed." from https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jost_von_Silenen

Translated from German using Google Translate:
"Version from: 24.11.2009
The word is derived from the Italian mazza (mace, mace) and denotes a symbol. Item used in riots in Valais in the 15th and 16th centuries. The M. appeared in various forms: first as a large wooden club, then as a carved human. Face with disfigured features placed on the burl of an ash tree, and finally as a human wearing a linen shirt. Shape. She was the main character of the matzah game and was played by the members of the matzah society on a bridge, at a fountain or on a public street. Place erected ( Customs). An intercessor prompted them or their bearer, the matzah master, to designate the person who was actually or alleged hated despotism and called on the spectators to a punitive expedition. Those who wanted to take part hammered a nail into the M. The matzah master carried the M. from village to village. As soon as enough conspirators were assembled, the game turned serious. The crowd moved to the accused's residence, expelled him and divided his belongings (see Social conflicts). The chroniclers of the 16th century wrongly saw the uprising against the Friars of Raron in 1414 as a matzah. The M. was first documented in 1488. Its most prominent victims were Bf. Jost von Silenen in 1496, Cardinal Matthäus Schiner in 1517 and the mercenary leader Georg Supersaxo in 1527. In 1550 the Zenden vowed not to use matzah or violence in the future, and in 1560 the district administrator issued a formal ban. M. was last mentioned in his farewells in 1572. In 1986 the custom of protesting against air pollution and in 1994 against the acceptance of the Alpine Initiative was revived. Conversely, the productions of 1989, 1995 and 2007 stood for the expansion of the Saint-Maurice-Saint-Gingolph railway line, the Olymp. 2002 Winter Games and the rehabilitation of the Saint-Gingolph-Evian railway line.

The head of the "wild man".  Illustration by Christoph Silberysen in the Schweizer Chronik, 1576 (Aargauer Kantonsbibliothek, Aarau, MsWettF 16: 1, p. 470; e-codices).

The symbolism of the M. is interpreted in different ways: positively as a symbol of the rights and freedoms of the people or the right to resist tyranny; negative in the brief of Pope Alexander VI. from 1500 as an idol, in the farewells as a sign of violence and in folklore. Literature as a symbol of death or a wild man. The matzah game is accordingly regarded as a conspiracy against the freedom of the Church, as superstition , as a means of popular justice, an instrument of revolution or a ritual of rebellion and is associated with the Heischezüge, the Wilder-Mann game, the Charivari and the carnival activities ( Fasnacht ) of the fraternities and the aspirations of the emerging bourgeoisie after emancipation from the world. Violence of the bishop linked."

The value of examining these 1500 and 1600 renderings is that some of the buildings in the picture had a possibility, if not a likelihood of having been constructed in the 1400s, thus could be compared to in the drawings of the manuscript.

Battle of Crevola / by Luzerner Schilling, 1513

"Diebold Schilling the Younger (before 1460 - 3 November 1515(?)) was the author of the "Luzerner Schilling", one of the Swiss illustrated chronicles, which he presented to the city council of Lucerne on 15 January 1513 (but which remained incomplete). He was the nephew of Diebold Schilling the Elder of Bern. The younger Diebold was a somewhat scandalous figure, not unlike his father Hans, brother to the elder Diebold, an adventurer who had sought his fortune at the court of Matthias Corvinus, and returned destitute in 1488. Diebold was a secretary in Lucerne from 1479, and received the priesthood in 1481. His behaviour was so unpriestly, however, that the city council locked him into the tower in 1487, where he remained imprisoned for two years before he was released on parole of exhibiting more appropriate behaviour in the future. After his release he was soon back to his old ways, and after he had killed a man after a tavern brawl, he was fined and obliged to read a mass for his victim every year. Diebold was fiercely anti-French, and he accused the Bernese in particular, as well as his fellow chronicler Petermann Etterlin because of their friendly attitude towards France. Diebold's own sympathies lay with the German emperor Maximilian I, who personally invited him to the Reichstag in Konstanz in 1507. As an author, Diebold's most important contribution to the historiography of his times is his account of the years 1507–1509, the events of which he tells in his own words as an eye-witness."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crevola (1487)

"The Battle of Crevola was fought in the spring of 1487, between a marauding Swiss army from the Valais and Lucerne[1][12] and troops from the Duchy of Milan,[1] for the supremacy of the Val d'Ossola (Eschental) .

Prelude
In the year 1487, for unknown but petty reasons, Bishop Jost von Silenen entered into dispute with the Count of Arona,[2] whose seignory was the Duke of Milan.[13] The Knight Albin von Silenen, brother of Bishop Jost von Silenen, was appointed the leader of this military expedition.[8] As soon as the Simplon pass was passable, the Swiss crossed into the Val d'Ossola; here they were joined by another 1,000 Swiss, who were returning from Savoy.[9]

Battle
The Swiss besieged Domo, occupied the castle of Mattarella, and terribly ravaged the impoverished valleys.[1] The Duke of Milan, however, ordered the Ossolani to keep the Swiss inactive with false peace negotiations, until the duchy could dispatch a sufficient army.[13] Once the troops were assembled, they were split into three separate corps under the command of Renato Trivulzio, Count Borromeo, and Gio. Pietro Bergamino.[5] The Swiss were once again marauding in the villages of the Valle Vigezzo, when they were assaulted by the Milanese troops from three sides.[13] The Swiss formed a square and a murderous combat ensued, in which the Swiss lost 800-1000 men and all their baggage.[9][5] The rest of the Swiss troops were allowed to flee into the impassable mountain range.[12] "

The Abbey of Saint-Maurice d'Agaune

 ![p1360146](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76194453/229006881-83517447-0427-4280-9de2-1db258b784ee.jpg)

It celebrates its 1500 years . It was founded in 515 by the future Burgundian king Saint Sigismund on the site of an older sanctuary housing the remains of Maurice d'Agaune , a 3rd-century martyr, erected by Théodore d'Octodure , the first known bishop of Valais.

The city of Agaune has also taken its name… The abbey has played a major role in regional history and is today the oldest abbey in Western Europe in activity to have been permanently occupied. The first king of Transjurane Burgundy, Rodolphe , was crowned there.

Originally and until the 9th century, it was the laus perennis that applied. The monks were then replaced by canons who adopted the rule of Saint Augustine in 1128. Since then, the congregation of regular canons of Saint-Maurice d'Agaune has been in place in the abbey.

Saint-Maurice is one of the stages of the Via Francigena , a pilgrimage route leading to Rome. It is mentioned as such by Sigéric , in 990, with the mention LI Sce Maurici (stage number starting from Rome).

Rudolf II was known to have purchased the manuscript for 600 ducats. Rudolph I was also known as Rudolph II:

"Rudolf II (18 July 1552 – 20 January 1612) was Holy Roman Emperor (1576–1612), King of Hungary and Croatia (as Rudolf I, 1572–1608), King of Bohemia (1575–1608/1611) and Archduke of Austria (1576–1608). He was a member of the House of Habsburg."

p.46
"Jost von Silenen comes from one of the oldest noble families in the canton of Uri, although not
from one of the great Swiss families, such as the Toggenburgs and the Kyburgs. The Sileni were
not yet counts, not princes like himself, but they were at least a minor nobility who had worked
their way up to service nobility - probably through the office of Meyerei. This is suggested by the
name Albin Meyer von Silenen, an ancestor of the bishop, who is often mentioned as a well-
known figure in the history of the founding of Switzerland, and who could also have been one of
the three swearers on the Rütli.

This ancestry alone must have been an initial motivation for Jost not only to become a Swiss
diplomat, but also to leave behind an important written work on the formation of the Swiss state.
Yes, it would be best to combine both at the same time, to create a work that praises his
achievements for Switzerland as a diplomat, but is also a community-building sermon at the same
time. On his mother's side, Jost von Silenen came from a much more important noble family
from France, the Chrevon family. 4

After he received benefices at the St. Leodegar Abbey in Lucerne early on, many suspected an
earlier date of birth, but it has not been finally clarified to this day. 1435 is mostly accepted.
Perhaps more important is his place of birth. He grew up in Küssnacht in the Gesslerburg from
the Wilhelm Tell Legend. Then went to Pavia to study law and came to Rome to study languages
as secretary to French cardinal Guillaume D'Estouteville, who was a splendid patron of the
Renaissance and certainly a role model for Jost von Silenen in terms of promoting the arts. Then
it went to the French court until he was appointed abbot of Beromünster. Together with
Nikolaus von Diesbach he is the French king's negotiator. However, it was mainly Jost of
Silenen who negotiated with the Habsburgs.

It was his merit that he negotiated the first enduring peace treaty with Ferdinand of Habsburg,
the so-called Eternal Direction, which guaranteed the Confederation of the time its first
independence and secured the status it had fought for as a free, democratic nation, which was
unique in Europe and which thought ahead to neutrality and so on can also be used for all times
as a model for peace in Europe and indeed in the world. At that time still officially called
Unification, but it was the first peace treaty around 1474 that set this eternal direction and made
peace possible even after the Swabian Wars. The Habsburgs were to give up their territory in
Alsace for a fee and in return receive a promise of support for military service from the
Confederates. Certainly, Charles the Bold's urge to conquer made the parties move closer
together. But there were now peaceful paths between two archenemies who have Not spared
themselves, which brought a lot of suffering to the population. However, it was not only about
territories, but also about civil liberties, which were guaranteed for the first time and at the
crucial moment. So Switzerland had resources free for the Burgundian wars, otherwise
Switzerland might not exist today. The French king Louis XI, who pulls the strings in the
background and was an enemy of Charles the Bold, made Jost of Silenen the bishop of Grenoble
as a thank you until he was appointed to the bishopric of Sion in 1482."

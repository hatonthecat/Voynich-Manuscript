# Voynich-Manuscript-(also a new claim it is the Silenen Codex)- see 3/28 10pm entry
Analysis, notes, resources, and theories about the unsolved Voynich Manuscript

Jost von Silenin analysis begins at this link: https://github.com/hatonthecat/Voynich-Manuscript/blob/main/README.md#1024-pm
----
Background
----
"The Voynich manuscript is an illustrated codex hand-written in an unknown script referred to as 'Voynichese'.[18] The vellum on which it is written has been carbon-dated to the early 15th century (1404–1438). Stylistic analysis indicates it may have been composed in Italy during the Italian Renaissance.[1][2] The origins, authorship, and purpose of the manuscript are debated. Hypotheses suggest that it is a script for a natural language or constructed language; an unread code, cypher, or other form of cryptography; or a meaningless hoax."

Approaches

Since there are many different theories, a list of some of the many theories will be analyzed. A comprehensive analysis would be needed, as several languages are used as substitution ciphers.

Some of the theories.

One person suggests the alphabet is "Bulgarian cirilic[cyrillic]":

"Voynich alphabet is Bulgarian, cirilic based.V.M.language is Middle Bulgarian hybrid. Hybrid part is Ottoman Turkish.Words shtovam,dyadov,harachi,yanyavar,spanak,varyavar can not be disputed. Who is going to be first to locate and confirm my findings. To help you out 8=V,9=E,2=R,C=S,X=H,4=SHT.The rest of the alphabet I am unable to type on this device. Thank you for your kind consideration. Sahbaz Bajrektarevic, peace."

Another, suggests it uses a pre-800 AD form of encoding"

Thank you for posting Mary’s clearly written book. Having excelled in cryptanalytics in the late 1950s , and freshly decoding Fibonacci’s 1292 AD ‘”Liber Abacl” 15 years ago, thanks to L.E Sigler, several number based attack approaches come to mind,:

First, infinite series problems were written by Fibonacci in finite arithmetic to
2-term and 3-term unit fraction series by subtracting LCM 1/m from n/p considered :

(n/p – 1/m) = (mn – p)/mn

1. 2-term series (mn – p) = 1

Example ( 3/11 – 1/4) = (12 – 11)/44 meant 3/11 = 1/4 + 1/44

2/ 3-term series subtracted a second LCM m

Example

(4/13 – 1/4) = (16 – 13)/52 = (3/52 – 1/18) = (54 – 52)/((18)(52)) = 1/468 meant

4/13 = 1/4 + 1/18 + 1/468

Encoding systems of this type date to 2050 BCE Egypt that scaled n/p by LCM m in a multiplication context such that

n/p x (m/m) = mn/mp

Found the Best divisors of mp that summed to mn …

created 2-term, 3-term, 4-term , and 5-term unit fraction series

Further encoding each numeral into Greek letters , Ionian or Doric, until 800 AD when Arabs ended the ciphered numeral step, and mentored Fibonacci to only write 2-term and 3-term series using numerals imported from India.

Bacon, Dee and other great medieval scholars, cryptographers , would have been aware of the older ciphered numeral to any available set of alphabetic characters … and used it to encode numeric data …hence minimal or virtually no actual language data may.be reported .

That is , only inventories may be reported, a type of message that also has been proven to be very difficult to break.

from Wikipedia:
" The first confirmed owner was Georg Baresch, a 17th-century alchemist from Prague. Baresch was apparently puzzled about this "Sphynx" that had been "taking up space uselessly in his library" for many years.[9] He learned that Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher from the Collegio Romano had published a Coptic (Egyptian) dictionary and claimed to have deciphered the Egyptian hieroglyphs; Baresch twice sent a sample copy of the script to Kircher in Rome, asking for clues. The 1639 letter from Baresch to Kircher is the earliest known mention of the manuscript to have been confirmed.[16]"

"In February this year, a paper published in the journal of the American Botanical Council said one of the plant drawings suggested a possible Mexican origin for the manuscript."

"He said he had managed to find the word for Taurus, alongside a picture of seven stars (seen as part of the zodiac constellation of Taurus) and the word Kantairon alongside a picture of the herb Centaury."

"Now, Bedfordshire University's Stephen Bax says he has deciphered 10 words, which could lead to more discoveries."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#Ciphers :
However, the presence of many tightly grouped shapes in the Voynich manuscript (such as "or", "ar", "ol", "al", "an", "ain", "aiin", "air", "aiir", "am", "ee", "eee", among others) does suggest that its cipher system may make use of a "verbose cipher", where single letters in a plaintext get enciphered into groups of fake letters. For example, the first two lines of page f15v (seen above) contain "oror or" and "or or oro r", which strongly resemble how Roman numerals such as "CCC" or "XXXX" would look if verbosely enciphered.[70]

The Catalan Wikipedia page for the Voynich Manuscript (translated using Google Translate)

"Statistical patterns 
The text consists of more than 170,000 characters, [20] with spaces dividing the text into approximately 35,000 groups of variable length, usually referred to as "words" or "words of words" (37,919); 8,114 of these words are considered unique "word types" . [21] The structure of these words seems to follow certain phonological or orthographic laws  ; for example, certain characters must appear in every word (like English vowels ), some characters never follow others, or some can be doubled or tripled, but others cannot.

The distribution of letters within words is also quite peculiar: some characters only occur at the beginning of a word, some only at the end, and some always in the middle section. [22] Professor Gonzalo Rubio, an expert on ancient languages ​​at Pennsylvania State University , stated: "the things we know as 'grammatical markers': things that usually occur at the beginning or end of words, such as 's "or" d "in our language, and which are used to express grammar, will never appear in the middle of "words" in the Voynich manuscript. This is unheard of for any Indo-European, Hungarian or Finnish language." [23] Many researchers have commented on the very regular structure of the words. [24]

The distribution of letters within the text is also strange. Stephan Vonfelt studied some statistical properties of the distribution of letters and their correlations (properties that can be loosely characterized as rhythmic resonance, alliteration, or assonance) and found that, in this sense, Voynichese is more similar to Chinese than to European languages, although the numerical differences between the Voynichès and the Chinese seem greater than those between the Chinese and European languages. [25]

Almost no word has fewer than two letters or more than ten. [20] Some words occur only in certain sections or on only a few pages; others occur throughout the manuscript. There are few repetitions among the thousand or more labels attached to the illustrations. There are cases where the same common word appears up to three times in a row [20] (see Zipf's law ). Words that differ by only one letter also repeat with unusual frequency, causing single-substitution alphabet decipherments to produce gibberish-like text"

"In 2014, a team led by Dr. Diego Amancio, from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Computing at the University of São Paulo, goespublish a paper detailing a study using statistical methods to analyze word relationships in text. Instead of trying to find meaning, Amancio's team used complex network modeling to look for connections and groups of words. Using concepts such as frequency and intermittency, which measure the occurrence and concentration of a term in the text, Amancio was able to discover the key words in the manuscript and create three-dimensional models of the text's structure and the frequencies of the words Their conclusion was that in 90% of cases, the Voynich systems are similar to those of other known books such as the Bible, indicating that the book is a real piece of text in a real language, and it's not good planned gibberish. [58]'

My Analysis
---

My first thought, after reading some of these ideas, was that to read the complete page on the Wikipedia entry on the Voynich Manuscript is to read all the 61 language pages it has been translated in, and hope that there is some information inferred or not incldued inthe other translations. That is, a computer AI did not automtically translate the 61 pages- those were coplted by Wikipedia volutneers. This is just the start of a resource, and ertainly there are many other places to begin, but it reflects more on the reader's biases to think only one language will have a better understanding. 

Thusm my theory is, what if the author of the Voynich Manuscript wanted to include other languages to intentionally require translators to understand other languages and not give preference to any specific one?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel#Themes

"The Tower of Babel (Hebrew: מִגְדַּל בָּבֶל‎, Mīgdal Bāḇel) narrative in Genesis 11:1–9 is an origin myth and parable meant to explain why the world's peoples speak different languages.[1][2][3][4]"
Themes
The story's theme of competition between God and humans appears elsewhere in Genesis, in the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.[13] The 1st-century Jewish interpretation found in Flavius Josephus explains the construction of the tower as a hubristic act of defiance against God ordered by the arrogant tyrant Nimrod. There have, however, been some contemporary challenges to this classical interpretation, with emphasis placed on the explicit motive of cultural and linguistic homogeneity mentioned in the narrative (v. 1, 4, 6).[14] This reading of the text sees God's actions not as a punishment for pride, but as an etiology of cultural differences, presenting Babel as the cradle of civilization."


I think that, if there was a need to encrypt a script (as it would be unlikely a language would use so many unique characters natively), it wold arise out of the need to hide a potentially persecutable belief, which could be an early religion, such as Judaism or Gnosticism.

If a language were banned, it would be a clear target. If a language was not banned, it would not have much of a threat in its era, at least. By writing a hard-to-decipher script, some possible value could be ascribed to it until a supposed Inquisitorial body could determine its affiliation. That is the pessimisstic view. 

The mundane view is that it is is a doodle notebook of a botanist who had an eye for natural biological architecture, which does not preclude the ability to have an interest in cipher/cryptography.

This was the Rennaissance, after all, when well-rounded scholars such as Leonardo Da Vinci were considered doctors, inventors, philosophers, things that could not be claimed with even a PhD and post-doc. The thesis approval process back then was non-existent, yet did not prevent great thinkers from influencing successful businessmen years ater. 

The Codex Leicester, for example, was purchased by Bill Gates in 1994, for $30.8 million (and is now worth $130 million). https://www.businessinsider.com/look-inside-the-codex-leicester-which-bill-gates-bought-for-30-million-2015-7#:~:text=In%201994%2C%20he%20purchased%20Leonardo,to%20select%20museums%20this%20summer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85YcMMhvvoQ (Though in many ways is worth more than that)

Good presentation https://github.com/joaoperfig/voynichstudies/blob/master/voynich.pdf : 

"There is not a single instance of a word being erased or corrected
(which suggests the book might be a copy) but some words have
been retouched"

This doesn't mean that a copy is a forgery, but rather that whoever wanted a copy - perhaps a king wanted an original, but the original was in such bad shape, or that there was something encoded in the original that he did not want left in. I prefer to start with the least plausible, so it should be relatively simple to examine more plausible reasons for making a copy. Photocopy machines didn't exist then, so would it be out of the ordinary to have no corrections? perhaps a wealthy buyer did not want any errors, and required his scribes to rewrite any pages that contained errors. Its not as if the pages had to be bounded before they were written.

Forgery Theory
---

"One of the most common tropes in the history of forgery is that of a rare book dealer "discovering" previously unknown manuscripts. Voynich is known to have had just this "magic" touch. He is also said to have acquired a supply of vellum and to have used his knowledge of chemistry gained at the University of Moscow to replicate medieval inks and pigments. "

"But until forensic tests are done on the ink and pigments - so far, only the vellum has been carbon dated to the 15th Century - the riddle of this mysterious book will continue to exert a powerful magnetic pull on present and future Voynichologists."

Other thoughts:
--
To take a contrarian view, what suggestion is there that the manuscript must have any meaning? There could be multiple reasons why the manuscript cannot be decoded with just one language, or at all. Since the story of Babel is in Genesis, which is in the Old Testament (everything I learned from the Old Testament I learned from Lewis Black: https://www.facebook.com/beststandupcomedy/videos/658478987635564/ at 2:30), what if the inability to decode it is due to the unwillingness for different languages to cooperate? Short of holding hands and singing Kumbaya around the Tower of Babel, the Man in the Sky may not have wanted to signal any help in decoding this manuscript. Thus, this puzzle is like a punishment for those who spent their entire lives having never decoded it, unless everyone trying to decode it is doing something wrong (something other than trying to decode it, assuming it is not a fatal knowledge). One article suggests it is the "venus flytrap" of brilliant minds. I would think that, the original author could not have foreseen that it would take so long to decode because he or she lived in a completely different time, but one where different types of knowledge were not dismissed. Perhaps, it is our willfull ignorance in ancient ways of thought that would constrain the ability to contextualize the meaning. In many ways, the Rennaissance appears more of a utopia compared to the present. Perhaps not in medical technology, but in many other cultural ways.

Much Ado about Botany
--

Maybe no one is right if a higher order planted the truth in every language, so as not to give preference to any language, unless they all cooperated. An academic, and empath wouldn't need to believe in the same religion to understand why this manuscript was written, not is that relgion necessarily knowable, but to consider the context of the era, the manuscript could have been written to hide from heresy, but if it was the last in a language, then it might have been a translation attempt, or some pagan text. That said, it is not possible to rule out any particular subject, despite the obvious botanical and pharmacopeiac illustrations. I call it Much ado about Botany.

I wonder why some think it was written by Roger Bacon- the paper appears too "new" to have been from 1200s (but it's not much newer if it carbon dating suggests the 1400s). Another idea is, the original might not have had all the doodlings- what if the original author wrote mainly the text, but other artisans added more drawings later on? This wouldn't be unprecedented- large churches were built for continuous expansion- they were not built with one vision in mind- a new wind here, a new bell and tower later on- nothing suggests the book had to be written in one sitting- that said, it could have been continued by just a handful, as the scribes have been estimated to be 6 or less. It would be interesting if it were a book from Norse travels from NewFoundland (which could have taken tales all the way from South America) but I think that far less likely. Perhaps Marco Polo transcribed a phonetic account of a middle-eastern language. Any traveller since then could have too.

There are a lot of interesting theories that many of them can sound very plausible, but also the fact that many centuries have added to the obfuscatory nature of the any hidden etchings and re-transcribings adds to the complexity.

I find the fact that some words were found in High German from the early 13th century interesting (https://web.archive.org/web/20111018025101/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf), but also some parallels that are not particularly related but interesting nonetheless:

"Kalush and Sloman posit that the only reason Houdini would abruptly leave the United States in 1900, when he had finally achieved notoriety—and a paycheck equivalent to $45,000 a week—was because he was engaged in espionage. Houdini was rumored to be providing the German police with information about wanted criminals, as well as unspecified information to Scotland Yard Superintendent William Melville, monitoring anarchists in Russia, and helping the U.S. Secret Service with their anti-counterfeiting mission." from: https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/was-houdini-a-spy/

Melville also worked with Schlomo Rosenblum (Sidney Reilly): 

"In the next ten years, Melville embarked on a large series of well-publicized raids against anarchists. He went to Victoria Station to personally arrest bomber Théodule Meunier.[1] In 1896 Melville recruited Shlomo Rosenblum (later known as Sidney Reilly) as an informer in an organization he suspected to be involved with Russian anarchists.[1]" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Melville

Reilly was aquainted with Ethel Voynich, who was Wilfrid Voynich's last wife (from 1902-1930); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Reilly#The_Gadfly

Granted, anti-counterfeiting was probably a standard job duty of the Scotland Yard and something a bookseller like Wilfrid Voynich needed to be acquainted with to ensure he wasn't purchasing a fake manuscript, but whether or not the availability of 500-year old blank parchment paper would be plausible is certainly extraordinary but not impossible, thus a rare opportunity to fabricate text with gibberish (or at least a convenient way to delay decoding of a cipher by including alongside other ancient texts on a shelf). That said, the ink would also need to have been carbon dated that far back (presumably also a rare case of having been stored in a container for 500 years without evaporating).

from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#Early_history: 

"Marci's 1665/1666 cover letter to Kircher says that, according to his friend the late Raphael Mnishovsky, the book had once been bought by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia for 600 ducats (66.42 troy ounce actual gold weight, or 2.07 kg). (Mnishovsky had died in 1644, more than 20 years earlier, and the deal must have occurred before Rudolf's abdication in 1611, at least 55 years before Marci's letter. However, Karl Widemann sold books to Rudolf II in March 1599.)

Wellcome Library, oil
Ernest Board's portrayal of Bacon in his observatory at Merton College
According to the letter, Mnishovsky (but not necessarily Rudolf) speculated that the author was 13th-century Franciscan friar and polymath Roger Bacon.[6] Marci said that he was suspending judgment about this claim, but it was taken quite seriously by Wilfrid Voynich, who did his best to confirm it.[16] Voynich contemplated the possibility that the author was Albertus Magnus if not Roger Bacon.[63]


Mathematician John Dee may have sold the manuscript to Emperor Rudolf around 1600.
The assumption that Bacon was the author led Voynich to conclude that John Dee sold the manuscript to Rudolf. Dee was a mathematician and astrologer at the court of Queen Elizabeth I of England who was known to have owned a large collection of Bacon's manuscripts.


Edward Kelley might have created the manuscript as a fraud
Dee and his scrier (spirit medium) Edward Kelley lived in Bohemia for several years, where they had hoped to sell their services to the emperor. However, this sale seems quite unlikely, according to John Schuster, because Dee's meticulously kept diaries do not mention it.[16]

If Bacon did not create the Voynich manuscript, a supposed connection to Dee is much weakened. It was thought possible, prior to the carbon dating of the manuscript, that Dee or Kelley might have written it and spread the rumor that it was originally a work of Bacon's in the hopes of later selling it.[64]: 249 

Fabrication by Voynich
Some suspect Voynich of having fabricated the manuscript himself.[7] As an antique book dealer, he probably had the necessary knowledge and means, and a lost book by Roger Bacon would have been worth a fortune. Furthermore, Baresch's letter and Marci's letter only establish the existence of a manuscript, not that the Voynich manuscript is the same one mentioned. These letters could possibly have been the motivation for Voynich to fabricate the manuscript, assuming that he was aware of them. However, many consider the expert internal dating of the manuscript and the June 1999[52] discovery of Baresch's letter to Kircher as having eliminated this possibility.[7][16]

Eamon Duffy says that the radiocarbon dating of the parchment (or, more accurately, vellum) "effectively rules out any possibility that the manuscript is a post-medieval forgery", as the consistency of the pages indicates origin from a single source, and "it is inconceivable" that a quantity of unused parchment comprising "at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins" could have survived from the early 15th century.[27]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee

"Dee eventually left Elizabeth's service and went on a quest for additional knowledge in the deeper realms of the occult and supernatural. He aligned himself with several individuals who may have been charlatans, travelled through Europe and was accused of spying for the English crown. Upon his return to England, he found his home and library vandalised. He eventually returned to the Queen's service, but was turned away when she was succeeded by James I.
In 1583, Dee met the impoverished yet popular Polish nobleman Albert Łaski, who, after overstaying his welcome at court, invited Dee to accompany him back to Poland.[19] With some prompting by the "angels" (again through Kelley) and by dint of his worsening status at court, Dee decided to do so. He, Kelley and their families left in September 1583, but Łaski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country.[34] Dee and Kelley began a nomadic life in Central Europe, meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences, which Dee detailed in his diaries and almanacs.[32][33] They had audiences with Emperor Rudolf II in Prague Castle and King Stephen Báthory of Poland, whom they attempted to convince of the importance of angelic communication. The Bathory meeting took place at the Niepołomice Castle (near Kraków, then capital of Poland) and was later analysed by Polish historians (Ryszard Zieliński, Roman Żelewski, Roman Bugaj) and writers (Waldemar Łysiak).[citation needed] While Dee was generally seen as a man of deep knowledge, he was mistrusted for his connection with the English monarch, Elizabeth I, for whom some thought (and still do) that Dee was a spy." 

Ok, so it is known that John Dee associated himself with charlatans, and Voynich believed Dee sold it to Rudolf. That doesn't mean Dee sold Rudolf a forgery, nor would Voynich be interested in purchasing a forgery (had he somehow concluded that and that the manuscript still had value), but he was interested enough that ciphers were one of his other posession: :

"Voynich relocated his London bookshop to 175 Piccadilly in 1917.[12] Also in 1917, based on rumors, Voynich was investigated by the FBI, in relation to his possession of Bacon's cipher. The report also noted that he dealt with manuscripts from the 13th, 12th, and 11th centuries, and that the value of his books at the time was half a million dollars. However, the investigation did not reveal anything significant beyond the fact that he possessed a secret code nearly a thousand years old.[4]"

https://www.colinmackinnon.com/attachments/The_US_BOI_File_on_Voynich_p.pdf <-[4] As for "thousand", Francis Bacon developed the cipher in 1605 (400 years prior), so it is unclear whether the 57 page report refers to an earlier cipher, or that is incorrect. Unless it implies that he was merely not in posesssion of the "newer" Bacon cipher.

Book stores and antique stores are not all above selling counterfeits, at least in popular portrayal: 

"And then we learn that some of these antiques are more like "antiques." We never know how many of Childan's antiques are actually clever forgeries, which definitely connects these antiques to issues of deceit and uncertainty. Add to that the fact that some of these fakes are made by "Frank Frink," who is himself kind of a fake, since he changed his name and nose to survive. (It's like the paper writes itself.)

Now, Childan doesn't know about his "antiques," but Wyndam-Matson clearly knows, since many of them come from his store. W-M has his own idea about authenticity and historicity, which is that it's all in the eye of the beholder. So for him, fakes are as real as authentic antiques as long as the person thinks it's real."

Which isn't to say anything about legitimate stores, but definitely an exploitable trade.

5:23PM - A Matter of Two Bacons
---

Update: After reading 1/2way through I found the answer:

The BOI report is fascinating- Voynich's mention of a Bacon cipher briefly got mixed up for Francis Bacon's cipher, when the mentions in other documents that Voynich was unambiguously referring to Roger Bacon (p.15):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76194453/228381484-e248ee16-3c55-4551-a4b6-a96d724e9d9d.png)

On p. 22, The BOI leter further adds: "If he thought he could be of any service to the Department, it was only because it appears to be an excellent cipher, in as much as it has for several years defied the efforts of experts to decipher it, and he thought it might be, as it undoubtedly would, of value to the War Department to posess so valuable a system, but obviously it can not be placed at the disposal of the Government until we succeed in ascertaining what the system is.

If Mr. Voynich said that he was acquainted wiht the army cipher, he said nothing more than any non-military man could have said who had read the published statements to the effect that the army was using the cipher disc[overy?]. This has been a matter of common knowledge for many years)."

This does make me wonder, for someone who was able to acquire many manuscripts, that German castles weren't exactly garage sales like in the U.S., thus the availability of certain rare texts could have been made available through less honest and surreptitious means-visting estates, pretending to be distant family, etc.

About those "garage sales"

https://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesEurope/EasternPoland_Voynich01.htm

"Wilfrid was a regular visitor to the Continent, in particular to Italy (during which he became friends with Achille Ratti, at that point a librarian, who would eventually become Pope Pius XI). He was able to buy large quantities of old books and manuscripts, from religious houses and other places, on one occasion persuading the religious in question to take what he considered to be modern tat in exchange for some wonderful old texts. In 1912 he visited the Villa Mondragone, Frascati, at the request of the Jesuits there - who wished to sell some of their books in order to raise funds (this being done, apparently, without the knowledge of their superiors)."

As I suspected, he purchased some heavily discounted texts using questionable practices, then marking them up in the UK and U.S.

"Among the books he acquired as a result of this transaction was a peculiar volume, of some age and obviously written in code, which was to provide him with a more than contemporary notability. (There are some arguments that the volume did not originate in the stated location - inter alia he said that he had acquired it from 'a castle' - and used the Villa as misdirection.)"

"intellectual vagrant"

An antiquated term, not often used.

https://books.apple.com/us/book/thoreau-beyond-borders/id1546666826

"Henry David Thoreau spent his life as an intellectual vagrant, jumping fences, pushing boundaries, and crossing borders. How, why, and to what end are the questions asked by contributors to this new volume of essays, whose work crosses national and disciplinary borders to think about Thoreau anew."

According to Google N-Gram viewer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ngram_Viewer

The phrase vagrant has decreased but cannot be found often adjacent "intellectual"

Notes, ideas and thoughts on the Silenen Codex:

The lecturer who wrote the article has a PhD, works at a Cistercian theological university, not just any theological university but with a parent organization as the Catholic Church. In the 1400s, when this manuscript is believed to have been written, the Catholic church authorities- the popes and bishops, were considered infallible.

"Because of the complexity in defining infallibility, some Protestant and non-denominational views confuse papal infallibility with impeccability, as if the Pope were immune from sin."

Viewed through the lens of philological analysis, as with scholar-priests such as Lorenzo Valla, the Catholic Church is arguably one of the most non-promotional institutions still in existence:

“Valla is “best known for his historical-critical textual analysis that proved that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery, therefore attacking and undermining the presumption of temporal power claimed by the papacy.[1] Lorenzo is sometimes seen as a precursor of the Reformation.[2][3]”

Only an institution committed to pursuing the truth, regardless of promotion, contradiction is capable of achieving that aim.

Furthermore,

In Centuries after Aristotle, in “Perspectives on Early Modern and Modern Intellectual History (Gates and Marino, 2001), on p.39:

“Erasmus has recourse to Jerome's auctoritas again in rebutting Poggio's other accusation at Valla-that by emending the Vulgate, Valla desecrated the most venerated text of Western Christianity. On this point too, Erasmus is clear and firm. In reality, Valla had completed the task begun by Jerome's, was intended to combat the errors and superficiality of biblical exegesis flawed by insufficient command of Latin and Greek. While Valla brought to bear on the New Testament his linguistic skills and literary erudition, he did not forget that these texts were fundamental for Christianity. Moreover, asserts Erasmus, Valla's research was in conformity with the norms established by the Council of Vienne (1311-12) and later included in the Constitutiones Clementinae. These norms imposed the study of biblical language on the students of theology, in order to secure a correct understanding of the Holy Scriptures.”

"This was the first instance of modern, scientific diplomatics. Independently of both Cusa and Valla, Reginald Pecocke, Bishop of Chichester (1450–57), reached a similar conclusion." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine Though the Donation of Constantine ended up on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, the Index was formally abolished on June 1966 by Pope Paul VI.

Thus, while the Church has not always become more transparent and more self-correcting, the effort by Dr. Bernhart-Königstein can be seen in the same light as Valla and Erasmus, in that it seeks to shed light on the philological mysteries of an era undergoing significant change, not just in Switzerland, but in Valois, Hapsburg and Italian kingdoms.

When I examine the veracity of something, the first thing I look for is, why would someone make something up, when the truth is more interesting than fiction? Not everyone is dishonest, regardless of interest. From p.46 of the Voynich-Silenen Comedy,

“The family, and thus also the Voynich-Silenen manuscript, gained special importance through the founding of the Swiss Guard, whose first captain was the nephew and son of Albin von Silenen's brother, Kaspar von Silenen. At that time, secular and spiritual principalities still formed a unit. In the Confederation and also in Valais, however, the power of the prince-bishop was severely restricted by the state council. In Switzerland, the bourgeoisie had taken power early on.

In diplomatic circles, the Silenen manuscript helped, the memoirs of Jost von Silenen possibly helped as a memorandum in the formation of the Swiss state. But it certainly became the ideological founding document, the charter of the Swiss Guard in the Vatican, whose captain was the nephew of Bishop Kaspar von Silenen. When he dies - a son followed him as captain - it falls into oblivion and is used as an alchemy book by Emperor Rudolf ll. and re-enter history as the Voynich Manuscript, until rediscovered by its readability as the Silenen Manuscript.

In fact, this discovery also contributes something to the history of Switzerland's national hero, Wilhelm Tell, but in a humorous way and with hints, there is no doubt about the intended reference to Tell, as he is perhaps the second great hero of Switzerland that has been underestimated (conditio sine qua non) and as the Creator of this manuscript also personally connected with the legend of Tell.'

If a story is bursting with humor, there is no need to embellish. The truth works for you, rather than the other way around.

Page 53: “III. An almost moral bishop”

In the manuscript, the bishop appears honest, but not impeccable. I think the ability to accurately assess this manuscript requires, at the very least, empathy in in the subject matter. If someone believes honesty is valueless, then they value appearance over substance. The question appears to be, not whether Jost di Silenen had anything to gain from writing this, of which there is important historical value, but what he had to lose in not writing. If he were religious, he may have preferred to write his conscience in the eyes of God, even (or in such a way) if no one else could decode it in his life time. As for the aforementioned memorandum of formation, that too may have been decipherable only to his dynasty.

Another point of context is this particularly unfalsifiable part:

“You can't really say it's written, rather it's designed, maybe sketched, co-organized as a client, because there is no example of this kind of art before him. And yet, as the humanist behind the work, Jost of Silenen himself should be considered. The references are too individual, the continuous connection with the biography is too unusual, the educational path, yes, the origin.

And finally, the work of self-panegyric clearly embodies the philosophy of life and the political mission expected of it. Not so rare in the Renaissance, but also typically Italian, that in diplomats, politicians, even more so in church people, artistic qualities such as Eneas Silvius Piccolomini, Gulio de Medici, would come to mind spontaneously.”

Certainly the illustrations of the Voynich manuscript are unique- not quite high-art, but not quite outsider art either, unless a Bishop's art is categorically considered sub-par. Rather, I think the uniqueness of the Rennaissance era, its foreignness in terms of religious values, pre-industrialization, pre-commercialization are moreso explanations of its “alien-ness” than anything specifically extraordinary to its contemporary era, other than the fact that Switzerland's founding was especially unique- in its supranational character. All this contributes to requiring a very extraordinary understanding of an era far removed from the current, and one that has many lessons that can be learned from. As they say, “it takes one to know one” may be unfair to say here (it is not possible to claim to understand or self-identify with a 500+ year old contemporary era - not even a Ren-Faire attendee could make that claim).

Memoirs have been written since ancient times, says Wikipedia, but how fitting it would be that one founder of the Old Swiss Confederacy would mix personal with state events, being unique. While many claims to unfalsifiable theories can appear impossible to prove, the Dr. Bernhard-Konigstein claims, or should I say teases, with hints that Jost of Silenen is betrayed by minor errors (p.52):

“All the details in the manuscript are important, To correctly interpret his message. There who wrote his fingers sore, But it is proclaimed here as a miracle With what many thousands of variants The same glyphs got mixed up. Even if it were a waste An eternal joke in every turn. But where I read the opaque text, Little by little he betrayed his nature, Also to understand botany I had to go into history.”

“The author was known to us for a long time He is already mentioned as a patron! He left us a breviary It is also historically easy to grasp! Yes, his knowledge of the last things Towers over the Hildegard of Bingen.”


But the doctor's own poem becomes more poetic, which is key to deciphering its origin:


“Yes, the Voynich, may we guess

Is as a picture a secret Morgarten.

Are also text and root in splendor,

They point us to this battle

Because even in the moor from time to time

Even the root likes to stand free.

Even if the soot is without a picture,

Enough of that are in world chronicles.

Every stalk in the global garden

Bears witness to Swiss semispecies.

However, if you are often in a group,

Impaled a flower head."

The “semi-species” is in reference to Switzerland's four national languages- German, French, Italian, and Romansh (Half-Swiss/Half-German, Half-Swiss/Half-French, Half-Swiss,Half Italian, etc), and the flowers petals with 4 heads connected, as well as diverse ethnic makeup, thus the plants with separately colored roots and stems pays homage to Switzerland's historical foundings. How poetic. Just a week ago, I gave a quick look at the many languages in the manuscript- what appeared to be Arabic, Hebrew, Cyrillic, and thought, whoever wrote this might have had a biblical interpretation of languages- something like the Tower of Babel, but there was nothing I could connect to a contemporary event (which isn't to say a real tower of babel once existed in ancient times, but the story itself was metaphorical).

I rate this claim highly inspired by religion, but no less implausible, since religion was the norm back then. In other words- all the more so due to its religious subtexts (glyphs, symbols), can be seen to match its contextual era. It was also, as the author points out, not yet separated from all of the following: stately, secular matters and nature.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#Statistical_patterns

" As noted in Bowern's review, multiple scribes or "hands" may have written the manuscript, possibly using two methods of encoding at least one natural language.[45][46][47][48] The "language" Voynich A appears in the herbal and pharmaceutical parts of the manuscript. The "language" known as Voynich B appears in the balneological section, some parts of the medicinal and herbal sections, and the astrological section. The most common vocabulary items of Voynich A and Voynich B are substantially different. Topic modeling of the manuscript suggests that pages identified as written by a particular scribe may relate to a different topic.[45]" 

Dr. Bernhart-Königstein's claims that it was written by  Jost von Silenen and his family, including his nephew, Kaspar von Silenen, would support the statistical analysis that two/multiple scribes contributed to it (perhaps in two different sections/topics as previously theorized).

What is the difference between a hoax and a comedy? 

Hoax:

"A hoax is a widely publicized falsehood so fashioned as to invite reflexive, unthinking acceptance by the greatest number of people of the most varied social identities and of the highest possible social pretensions to gull its victims into putting up the highest possible social currency in support of the hoax.[1]

Whereas the promoters of frauds, fakes, and scams devise them so that they will withstand the highest degree of scrutiny customary in the affair, hoaxers are confident, justifiably or not, that their representations will receive no scrutiny at all. They have such confidence because their representations belong to a world of notions fundamental to the victims' views of reality, but whose truth and importance they accept without argument or evidence, and so never question.

Some hoaxers intend eventually to unmask their representations as in fact a hoax so as to expose their victims as fools; seeking some form of profit, other hoaxers hope to maintain the hoax indefinitely, so that it is only when sceptical persons willing to investigate their claims publish their findings that at last they stand revealed as hoaxers."

Comedy:

Comedy is a genre of fiction that consists of discourses or works intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, film, stand-up comedy, television, radio, books, or any other entertainment medium. The term originated in ancient Greece: In Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by political satire performed by comic poets in theaters.[1] The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance pitting two groups, ages, genders, or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old".[2] A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions posing obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth then becomes constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to resort to ruses which engender dramatic irony, which provokes laughter.[3]"

That Dr. Bernhart-Königstein chose to name the manuscript a "Comedy" is revealing in itself. It suggests familiarity with the topic, and possibly historical knowledge going as far back as the Ancient Greek definition of Old Comedy.

On p. 47: 

"The family, and thus also the Voynich-Silenen manuscript, gained special importance through
the founding of the Swiss Guard, whose first captain was the nephew and son of Albin von
Silenen's brother, Kaspar von Silenen. At that time, secular and spiritual principalities still
formed a unit. In the Confederation and also in Valais, however, the power of the prince-bishop
was severely restricted by the state council. In Switzerland, the bourgeoisie had taken power
early on.

In diplomatic circles, the Silenen manuscript helped, the memoirs of Jost von Silenen possibly
helped as a memorandum in the formation of the Swiss state. But it certainly became the
ideological founding document, the charter of the Swiss Guard in the Vatican, whose captain was
the nephew of Bishop Kaspar von Silenen. When he dies - a son followed him as captain - it falls
into oblivion and is used as an alchemy book by Emperor Rudolf ll. and re-enter history as the
Voynich Manuscript, until rediscovered by its readability as the Silenen Manuscript.

In fact, this discovery also contributes something to the history of Switzerland's national hero,
Wilhelm Tell, but in a humorous way and with hints, there is no doubt about the intended
reference to Tell, as he is perhaps the second great hero of Switzerland that has been
underestimated (conditio sine qua non) and as the Creator of this manuscript also personally
connected with the legend of Tell.'

The "amusing" aspect is that Jost of Silenen appears to have been a clever negotiator of peace, even though he faced quite a bit of competition.

p.52
"But where I read the opaque text,
Little by little he betrayed his nature,
Also to understand botany
I had to go into history."

p.45

"And we have to turn it up a notch ourselves: in the Silenen Swiss comedy, the people of
Switzerland are given something belatedly that unexpectedly strengthens their identity like it
hasn't since Friedrich Schiller. What came together through battles and demarcations, what was
strengthened by a common tradition and alliances, always threatened to break apart through the
differences in languages, denominations and cultures in the mountains and valleys. What is
astonishing about Swiss patriotism, which runs counter to all European nationalisms, is its
supranational character. This Helvetic construction, which could actually only have come about
in a supranational world of the Middle Ages, seems to have formed a stable community that has
endured and shaped the Alps to this day.

Even if the Sonderbund war has long since been settled, no one should assume that the neutral
cohesion of such a diverse people, especially in today's centralized European Union, does not
require a new, further unifying document at any time. So it would also be a special joy for all
European citizens if such a new document of stability and peace, as the democratic model, had
been found, especially in the most unexpected unpeaceful times in Europe a new message of
peace comes at the right time. History shows that peace can succeed if there are good diplomats
like Jost of Silenen.

Jost of Silenen is little known today, but that could change very quickly. In 1482 he was made
bishop of in Wallis. He is quite a successful historical figure, politically and also as a
patron of the arts, even if he was deposed as a bishop at the end of his life. But he was even more
successful than we previously knew, namely as a Swiss patriot. Who would have guessed that
500 years later he would be remembered for a very special reason. Apart from his political
commitment, he himself had made a significant contribution to his spiritual monument and its
indicated impact. In the work that we still call the “Voynich Manuscript” for the time being.

p.46

"It was his merit that he negotiated the first enduring peace treaty with Ferdinand of Habsburg,
the so-called Eternal Direction, which guaranteed the Confederation of the time its first
independence and secured the status it had fought for as a free, democratic nation, which was
unique in Europe and which thought ahead to neutrality and so on can also be used for all times
as a model for peace in Europe and indeed in the world. At that time still officially called
Unification, but it was the first peace treaty around 1474 that set this eternal direction and made
peace possible even after the Swabian Wars. The Habsburgs were to give up their territory in
Alsace for a fee and in return receive a promise of support for military service from the
Confederates. Certainly, Charles the Bold's urge to conquer made the parties move closer
together. But there were now peaceful paths between two archenemies who have Not spared
themselves, which brought a lot of suffering to the population. However, it was not only about
territories, but also about civil liberties, which were guaranteed for the first time and at the
crucial moment. So Switzerland had resources free for the Burgundian wars, otherwise
Switzerland might not exist today. The French king Louis XI, who pulls the strings in the
background and was an enemy of Charles the Bold, made Jost of Silenen the bishop of Grenoble
as a thank you until he was appointed to the bishopric of Sion in 1482."

A workhorse, of diplomatic gruntwork. Jost of Silenen would have been powerless, had he not invented a meritable solution for Swiss patriotism. Many of us are familiar with under-appreciated statesmen, such as Richard Holbrooke, who had a post-mortem biographical documentary made by his son, called The Diplomat: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diplomat_(2015_film)

And the undervalue of diplomacy is also highlighted in the humorous Norwegian music video tribute by Yvis - Jan Egeland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn-oemgzlEU

Thus, the joke is on those who do not value peace.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor

"Occam's razor, Ockham's razor, or Ocham's razor (Latin: novacula Occami) in philosophy is the problem-solving principle that recommends searching for explanations constructed with the smallest possible set of elements. It is also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony (Latin: lex parsimoniae). Attributed to William of Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher and theologian, it is frequently cited as Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem, which translates as "Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity",[1][2] although Occam never used these exact words. Popularly, the principle is sometimes inaccurately[3] paraphrased as "The simplest explanation is usually the best one."[4]"

The analysis encourages the reader to consider all the information on page 52:

"All the details in the manuscript are important,
To correctly interpret his message.
There who wrote his fingers sore,
But it is proclaimed here as a miracle
With what many thousands of variants
The same glyphs got mixed up."

Parsimonious and holistic considerations are not mutually exclusive, rather, they are like a Venn Diagram for comparing the explanation of a solar system within a larger, suspected, but yet undetermined (contemporary to the era) galaxy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_knowledge_about_galaxies,_clusters_of_galaxies,_and_large-scale_structure
For example, the concept of heliocentricism, while not directly related to the concept of galaxies, was not apparent in the 1400s, thus geo-centricism would have grouped stars and planets alike. (not distant galaxies have some of their own heliocentricism, which revolve around Earth, or, "as long as they ultimately revolve around earth"- no, it seemed to assume all planets and distant stars orbited around earth, period) 

In other words, the Swiss Bishop theory of authorship is a tiny interpretation, but no less impossible- one that requires at least some inspiration at looking at the stars, even if in a geocentric mentality, to eventually correctly re-orient one's mirror neurons to a different axis, and to be the first to hypothesize heliocentricism. 

By "tiny", I am referring to p.45:

"The references are too individual, the continuous connection with the biography is too unusual, the educational path, yes, the origin."

and (I know some of the quotes are repeated, but) p.46: 

"It was his merit that he negotiated the first enduring peace treaty with Ferdinand of Habsburg,
the so-called Eternal Direction, which guaranteed the Confederation of the time its first
independence and secured the status it had fought for as a free, democratic nation, which was
unique in Europe and which thought ahead to neutrality and so on can also be used for all times
as a model for peace in Europe and indeed in the world."

When one thinks of Europe on a map, it one might first think of the outward, shoreful countries- Spain, France, Italy, and those that jut out, like <i>Jutland</i>. It is often easy to overlook Switzerland- not only because of its uniquess, but its landlocked, and while beautiful mountainous,  difficult terrain. Thus it sometimes paradoxically is more common to overlook something potentially hiding in plain sight- it is not always obvious of course, but as he poetically references Newton- "standing on the shoulders of giants" (p.49), and, that it was sitting not far from Switzerland for much of its life, although, not without incident:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#History
"No records of the book for the next 200 years have been found, but in all likelihood, it was stored with the rest of Kircher's correspondence in the library of the Collegio Romano (now the Pontifical Gregorian University).[16] It probably remained there until the troops of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy captured the city in 1870 and annexed the Papal States. The new Italian government decided to confiscate many properties of the Church, including the library of the Collegio.[16] Many books of the university's library were hastily transferred to the personal libraries of its faculty just before this happened, according to investigations by Xavier Ceccaldi and others, and those books were exempt from confiscation.[16] Kircher's correspondence was among those books, and so, apparently, was the Voynich manuscript, as it still bears the ex libris of Petrus Beckx, head of the Jesuit order and the university's rector at the time.[12][16]

Beckx's private library was moved to the Villa Mondragone, Frascati, a large country palace near Rome that had been bought by the Society of Jesus in 1866 and housed the headquarters of the Jesuits' Ghislieri College.[16]

In 1903, the Society of Jesus (Collegio Romano) was short of money and decided to sell some of its holdings discreetly to the Vatican Library. The sale took place in 1912, but not all of the manuscripts listed for sale ended up going to the Vatican.[62] Wilfrid Voynich acquired 30 of these manuscripts, among them the one which now bears his name.[16] He spent the next seven years attempting to interest scholars in deciphering the script, while he worked to determine the origins of the manuscript.[4]"

Abductive reasoning, Inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, all play a significant role, though not in any order of decreasing importance.

I am reminded of a scene where in Peter Seller's Being there (1979), the president who becomes alerted to the suspicious new character of the gardener, meets with advisors who believe he is working for the FBI or CIA (due to some details such as the clothing he has was made from a garment factory from the 1930s and no longer exists). This kind of post-hoc fallacious reasoning leads many to assume that post-15 century methods of encryption and beliefs could explain the "real" meaning of something which, if its carbon dating is to be believed, and I have every reason to believe that, then it would have to be interepreted from the era it came from, not from high-tech RSA encryption, which wasn't an idea back then. 

p.48
"However, there is no historical chronology, but a regional arrangement. In
this respect, the term chronicle is not entirely appropriate. It is the bishop's personal choice, and
often more present than thought of retrospectively, the deciphered text tells us."

Some interesting background:

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazze 

"The matzah is an object and the popular uprising named after it, which was triggered in a ritualized form in medieval Valais .

The object of matzah was usually a wooden trunk with a carved human face with grotesque features.

The seizure of the matzah was the beginning of a popular uprising. It went something like this: the matzah was usually hung on a tree in a village square overnight. The following morning the residents gathered and waited for an initiate to seize the matzah and carry it away. The people followed this man, the matzah master, until he put the matzah on the ground. The residents gathered around the matzah and began to ask her questions such as: "Mazzah, what do you want?", "Mazzah, what is wrong with you?" etc. The matzah, of course, remained silent, whereupon the people demanded a lawyer for the matzah . An eloquent initiate offered himself as advocate to the crowd and also began questioning the matzah. To make it exciting, he first asked trivial questions, whereupon the matzah master shook the matzah in the negative, until after some time, in a heated mood, the lawyer made the right assumptions and accusations. The matzah master now performed a wild, joyful dance with the matzah. The lawyer turned to the people and shouted: "You have heard the complaints of the matzah, now discuss what to do!" So the conspiracy began, everyone present who agreed with the decisions drove a nail into the matzah .

The best-known case of the matzah seizure in Valais history took place in 1496, when the pro-France and therefore unpopular bishop Jost von Silenen was relieved of his office by the rebellious people and chased out of the country within a few days, which, after a brief interlude by his uncle Nicolaus Schiner, made him the declared France enemy Matthäus Schiner came to the bishopric.'

"As a politician, Georg Supersaxo (* around 1450; † 1529 in Vevey ; also Jörg auf der Flüe ) held the various offices of Zehndenmeier of Mörel , Grand Kastlan of Anniviers , provincial clerk of the Valais , secretary of Matthäus Schiner . As head of the Milan party and tribune of the people, he carried the matzah against Jost von Silenen according to customs and developed into the antagonist of his pupil and later bishop Matthäus Schiner." 

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Supersaxo 

"His campaigns in the Val d'Ossola failed, finally the Confederates were defeated by the Duchy of Milan at the Battle of Crevola , which led to a peace in 1495. Without power and reputation and under pressure from Georg Supersaxo , Jost von Silenen withdrew to Lyon and was deposed as bishop by the Pope in 1497; most recently he was titular bishop ofHierapolis . Attempts to recapture him failed." from https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jost_von_Silenen

Translated from German using Google Translate:
"Version from: 24.11.2009
The word is derived from the Italian mazza (mace, mace) and denotes a symbol. Item used in riots in Valais in the 15th and 16th centuries. The M. appeared in various forms: first as a large wooden club, then as a carved human. Face with disfigured features placed on the burl of an ash tree, and finally as a human wearing a linen shirt. Shape. She was the main character of the matzah game and was played by the members of the matzah society on a bridge, at a fountain or on a public street. Place erected ( Customs). An intercessor prompted them or their bearer, the matzah master, to designate the person who was actually or alleged hated despotism and called on the spectators to a punitive expedition. Those who wanted to take part hammered a nail into the M. The matzah master carried the M. from village to village. As soon as enough conspirators were assembled, the game turned serious. The crowd moved to the accused's residence, expelled him and divided his belongings (see Social conflicts). The chroniclers of the 16th century wrongly saw the uprising against the Friars of Raron in 1414 as a matzah. The M. was first documented in 1488. Its most prominent victims were Bf. Jost von Silenen in 1496, Cardinal Matthäus Schiner in 1517 and the mercenary leader Georg Supersaxo in 1527. In 1550 the Zenden vowed not to use matzah or violence in the future, and in 1560 the district administrator issued a formal ban. M. was last mentioned in his farewells in 1572. In 1986 the custom of protesting against air pollution and in 1994 against the acceptance of the Alpine Initiative was revived. Conversely, the productions of 1989, 1995 and 2007 stood for the expansion of the Saint-Maurice-Saint-Gingolph railway line, the Olymp. 2002 Winter Games and the rehabilitation of the Saint-Gingolph-Evian railway line.

The head of the "wild man".  Illustration by Christoph Silberysen in the Schweizer Chronik, 1576 (Aargauer Kantonsbibliothek, Aarau, MsWettF 16: 1, p. 470; e-codices).

The symbolism of the M. is interpreted in different ways: positively as a symbol of the rights and freedoms of the people or the right to resist tyranny; negative in the brief of Pope Alexander VI. from 1500 as an idol, in the farewells as a sign of violence and in folklore. Literature as a symbol of death or a wild man. The matzah game is accordingly regarded as a conspiracy against the freedom of the Church, as superstition , as a means of popular justice, an instrument of revolution or a ritual of rebellion and is associated with the Heischezüge, the Wilder-Mann game, the Charivari and the carnival activities ( Fasnacht ) of the fraternities and the aspirations of the emerging bourgeoisie after emancipation from the world. Violence of the bishop linked."

The value of examining these 1500 and 1600 renderings is that some of the buildings in the picture had a possibility, if not a likelihood of having been constructed in the 1400s, thus could be compared to in the drawings of the manuscript.

"Diebold Schilling the Younger (before 1460 - 3 November 1515(?)) was the author of the "Luzerner Schilling", one of the Swiss illustrated chronicles, which he presented to the city council of Lucerne on 15 January 1513 (but which remained incomplete). He was the nephew of Diebold Schilling the Elder of Bern. The younger Diebold was a somewhat scandalous figure, not unlike his father Hans, brother to the elder Diebold, an adventurer who had sought his fortune at the court of Matthias Corvinus, and returned destitute in 1488. Diebold was a secretary in Lucerne from 1479, and received the priesthood in 1481. His behaviour was so unpriestly, however, that the city council locked him into the tower in 1487, where he remained imprisoned for two years before he was released on parole of exhibiting more appropriate behaviour in the future. After his release he was soon back to his old ways, and after he had killed a man after a tavern brawl, he was fined and obliged to read a mass for his victim every year. Diebold was fiercely anti-French, and he accused the Bernese in particular, as well as his fellow chronicler Petermann Etterlin because of their friendly attitude towards France. Diebold's own sympathies lay with the German emperor Maximilian I, who personally invited him to the Reichstag in Konstanz in 1507. As an author, Diebold's most important contribution to the historiography of his times is his account of the years 1507–1509, the events of which he tells in his own words as an eye-witness."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crevola (1487)

"The Battle of Crevola was fought in the spring of 1487, between a marauding Swiss army from the Valais and Lucerne[1][12] and troops from the Duchy of Milan,[1] for the supremacy of the Val d'Ossola (Eschental) .

Prelude
In the year 1487, for unknown but petty reasons, Bishop Jost von Silenen entered into dispute with the Count of Arona,[2] whose seignory was the Duke of Milan.[13] The Knight Albin von Silenen, brother of Bishop Jost von Silenen, was appointed the leader of this military expedition.[8] As soon as the Simplon pass was passable, the Swiss crossed into the Val d'Ossola; here they were joined by another 1,000 Swiss, who were returning from Savoy.[9]

Battle
The Swiss besieged Domo, occupied the castle of Mattarella, and terribly ravaged the impoverished valleys.[1] The Duke of Milan, however, ordered the Ossolani to keep the Swiss inactive with false peace negotiations, until the duchy could dispatch a sufficient army.[13] Once the troops were assembled, they were split into three separate corps under the command of Renato Trivulzio, Count Borromeo, and Gio. Pietro Bergamino.[5] The Swiss were once again marauding in the villages of the Valle Vigezzo, when they were assaulted by the Milanese troops from three sides.[13] The Swiss formed a square and a murderous combat ensued, in which the Swiss lost 800-1000 men and all their baggage.[9][5] The rest of the Swiss troops were allowed to flee into the impassable mountain range.[12] "

"It celebrates its 1500 years . It was founded in 515 by the future Burgundian king Saint Sigismund on the site of an older sanctuary housing the remains of Maurice d'Agaune , a 3rd-century martyr, erected by Théodore d'Octodure , the first known bishop of Valais.

The city of Agaune has also taken its name… The abbey has played a major role in regional history and is today the oldest abbey in Western Europe in activity to have been permanently occupied. The first king of Transjurane Burgundy, Rodolphe , was crowned there.

Originally and until the 9th century, it was the laus perennis that applied. The monks were then replaced by canons who adopted the rule of Saint Augustine in 1128. Since then, the congregation of regular canons of Saint-Maurice d'Agaune has been in place in the abbey.

Saint-Maurice is one of the stages of the Via Francigena , a pilgrimage route leading to Rome. It is mentioned as such by Sigéric , in 990, with the mention LI Sce Maurici (stage number starting from Rome)."

Rudolf II was known to have purchased the manuscript for 600 ducats. Rudolph I was also known as Rudolph II:

"Rudolf II (18 July 1552 – 20 January 1612) was Holy Roman Emperor (1576–1612), King of Hungary and Croatia (as Rudolf I, 1572–1608), King of Bohemia (1575–1608/1611) and Archduke of Austria (1576–1608). He was a member of the House of Habsburg." 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor

p.46
"Jost von Silenen comes from one of the oldest noble families in the canton of Uri, although not
from one of the great Swiss families, such as the Toggenburgs and the Kyburgs. The Sileni were
not yet counts, not princes like himself, but they were at least a minor nobility who had worked
their way up to service nobility - probably through the office of Meyerei. This is suggested by the
name Albin Meyer von Silenen, an ancestor of the bishop, who is often mentioned as a well-
known figure in the history of the founding of Switzerland, and who could also have been one of
the three swearers on the Rütli.

This ancestry alone must have been an initial motivation for Jost not only to become a Swiss
diplomat, but also to leave behind an important written work on the formation of the Swiss state.
Yes, it would be best to combine both at the same time, to create a work that praises his
achievements for Switzerland as a diplomat, but is also a community-building sermon at the same
time. On his mother's side, Jost von Silenen came from a much more important noble family
from France, the Chrevon family. 4

After he received benefices at the St. Leodegar Abbey in Lucerne early on, many suspected an
earlier date of birth, but it has not been finally clarified to this day. 1435 is mostly accepted.
Perhaps more important is his place of birth. He grew up in Küssnacht in the Gesslerburg from
the Wilhelm Tell Legend. Then went to Pavia to study law and came to Rome to study languages
as secretary to French cardinal Guillaume D'Estouteville, who was a splendid patron of the
Renaissance and certainly a role model for Jost von Silenen in terms of promoting the arts. Then
it went to the French court until he was appointed abbot of Beromünster. Together with
Nikolaus von Diesbach he is the French king's negotiator. However, it was mainly Jost of
Silenen who negotiated with the Habsburgs.

It was his merit that he negotiated the first enduring peace treaty with Ferdinand of Habsburg,
the so-called Eternal Direction, which guaranteed the Confederation of the time its first
independence and secured the status it had fought for as a free, democratic nation, which was
unique in Europe and which thought ahead to neutrality and so on can also be used for all times
as a model for peace in Europe and indeed in the world. At that time still officially called
Unification, but it was the first peace treaty around 1474 that set this eternal direction and made
peace possible even after the Swabian Wars. The Habsburgs were to give up their territory in
Alsace for a fee and in return receive a promise of support for military service from the
Confederates. Certainly, Charles the Bold's urge to conquer made the parties move closer
together. But there were now peaceful paths between two archenemies who have Not spared
themselves, which brought a lot of suffering to the population. However, it was not only about
territories, but also about civil liberties, which were guaranteed for the first time and at the
crucial moment. So Switzerland had resources free for the Burgundian wars, otherwise
Switzerland might not exist today. The French king Louis XI, who pulls the strings in the
background and was an enemy of Charles the Bold, made Jost of Silenen the bishop of Grenoble
as a thank you until he was appointed to the bishopric of Sion in 1482."

Just realized Google Translate allows feeding entire documents in, so I was able to get better formatted translations of the Captions and German sections into English and relevant languages as a priority. The files begin with "MACHINE TRANSLATED_YOUR LANGUAGE" I encourage English readers to use this one instead (at least as a supplement) of the original one psoted by the doctor, since there is some information not completetly translated in the original. Currently, translations have been generated for English, French, Italian, and Spanish.

Added several languages from A-C, plus other common languages around the world Link to the original is https://github.com/hatonthecat/Voynich-Manuscript/blob/main/PDF_20230310_OTS0148_0.pdf for German. The benefit of using the translated one is that the original only translates the poem section, whereas using the translation reveals additinal info around the captions, including more information about the websites, which will also be traced for additional references.

"The Old Confederacy was created as a loose alliance of three valleys in central Switzerland: Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. They were rebelling against the governors of the Counts of Habsburg. The sought a recovery of old rights of autonomy and not a disengagement from the German Reich."
from: https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/planning/about-switzerland/history-of-switzerland/rise-of-the-swiss-confederation/

Further quoting above link:

"Increasing territory, static membership

For over a century no new members joined the Confederation while the territory of the Alliance increasingly grew in size.

In 1415, the Confederates conquered Aargau, which up until then was part of Austria. Most of the Aargau was then divided up between Bern, Zurich and Lucerne, with the remainder being managed as "common lordships". The same fate befell the Austrian Thurgau, which was acquired in 1460 by seven of the Confederate Places and was subsequently managed by bailiffs.

Appenzell and Toggenburg (the latter is now part of Canton St. Gallen), the monastery and city of St. Gallen, Schaffhausen, Fribourg, Biel and Solothurn came under Confederate control as so-called Associated Places.

Subjects and allies

Relations between the Confederates and the other parts of what is now Switzerland took several different forms, ranging from subjection to freedom of choice and a great deal of power.

The least amount of freedom was enjoyed by the areas administered as "common lordships". Specifically, this meant that the Confederation members took it in turns to appoint a bailiff.
The urban members of the Confederacy also had their own subjects. For example, towns in the surrounding rural areas. These subjects (Landschaft in German) often enjoyed a considerable amount of autonomy, with some even being able to appoint their own local authorities.
Other places were gradually incorporated under the terms of a Burgrecht alliance with a town, monastery or individual nobleman. In general, the ally provided troops in exchange for access to town markets. Bern used this system to extend its power westwards.
Finally, there were areas known as "Associated Places" whose status varied considerably. Some eventually joined the Confederation as full members, while others became protectorates."

p.158 of the Voynich manuscript vaguely resembles the Hajj in Mecca, replacing minarets for turrets, although I am have not yet been able to identify any Swiss figures who were at the time inspired by Islamic art. The historically revered Saint Maurice, the latter of which is located in Saint-Maurice, Canton of Valais (pictured and linked above), was a Coptic Egyptian (he also predates Islam by nearly 400 years. However, Switzerland is referred by Dr. Bernhart-Königstein as "supranational", and perhaps at least for cryptological/metaphorical purposes in the 15th century, Islam was known to be too and could have been used as a supranational substitute cipher for Switzerland. But if you look at the turrets/minarets, they have been cut off, which is intriguingely reminiscient of Swiss power(to a time where the literal was more common, but also analagous in the figurative, present sense-"an-archic" means  "no arch" or "no-head" and the Old Swiss confederacy, with roots in the 1300s, certainly meets that qualification). The secular capos of state (in the French, German and Italian regions, not yet called that) warred against the cantons' Bishop-Princes like Jost-de-Silenen in the Swiss regions.

There is an important difference- an-archic can mean absense of any government, which can be interpreted as chaotic. Many interpretations of the term involve some form of non-hierarchical structure: "Anarchists seek a system based on the abolition of all forms of societal hierarchy, in particular the state, and many advocate for the creation of a system of direct democracy, worker cooperatives or privatization.[5][6]"

Thus when one thinks of Switzerland, they do not think of it being exactly "anarchic," as the term is used in some Western countries to portray a certain "group" or "groups" (being a partial contradition when used to identify a group of any), but

"Switzerland has a tradition of direct democracy. For any change in the constitution, a referendum is mandatory (mandatory referendum); for any change in a law, a referendum can be requested (optional referendum). In addition, the people may present a constitutional popular initiative to introduce amendments to the federal constitution. The people also assume a role similar to the constitutional court, which does not exist, and thus act as the guardian of the rule of law."

"Saint Maurice (also Moritz, Morris, or Mauritius; Coptic: Ⲁⲃⲃⲁ Ⲙⲱⲣⲓⲥ) was an Egyptian military leader who headed the legendary Theban Legion of Rome in the 3rd century, and is one of the favorite and most widely venerated saints of that martyred group. He is the patron saint of several professions, locales, and kingdoms."

At the time, the Ottoman empire had a caliphate, and Sosse Silenen was appointed titular Bishop of Hierapolis, which was in Turkey! When searching "Hierapolis, one of the first results was a tourist page  
https://turkeytravelplanner.com/go/Aegean/Pamukkale/sights/hierapolis.html highlighting Turkish attractions- but seeing the blue domed Mosque on the banner, which I didn't immediately realize was not in Hieropolis- did a reverse image search with Tineye.com to locate it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mosque,_Istanbul  Whether or not he travelled there I don't know, but it is possible someone had sketches of an early mosque. the Blue Mosque began construction in 1609, completed in 1616, thus it is unlikeley someone drew inspiration from that (assuming the Voynich illustrations pertaining to the micelles/lipids/dendrites/plant "organs" were drawn in the 1400s).

from the page: 

"It is also known as the site where the Apostle Philip was supposedly martyred and buried. Notable archaeological structures include one of the largest surviving necropoleis in Turkey,  two Roman baths, colonnaded streets, Byzantine gatehouses, a massive theater, a Gate to the Underworld, the Martyrium of Philip, as well as an Archeological Museum. Hierapolis is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site!"

Baths were common in Roman outposts, so there is no suprise there. yet, being entrusted with the role of an ancient city in ruins, it partly reflected his downfall, thus suggests the title was a consolation prize (like being appointed ambassador of a tiny island country or city-state, no offense). For reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titular_bishop He was not in charge of a diocese, and virtually all bishops no longer carry any jurisdictional power outside the Vatican except for some uniqe microstates such as Andorra: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Urgell, where there remains a Co-Prince Bishop- and is technically a joint-head-of-state. Towards the end of Josse de Silenen's role as a Prince-Bishop, his role was tranferred to titular.

"Valère organ
The organ on the west side of the Valère basilica, believed to have been built in 1435, is one of the oldest functioning in the world. It was probably brought to the church by Guillaume de Rarogne, who eventually ended up as the bishop of Sion. Its pipes are arranged to form a rough outline of a church; the larger pipes form two towers, and the smaller ones create a triangular church roof. The organ was modified in the 1700s to play Baroque music, but otherwise remains essentially unchanged.[9] It was renovated in 1954, around the time that another famous early model – the Rysum organ – was repaired."

"A modest organ in the Valère basilica in southern Switzerland claims a proud record: that of “the oldest organ in the world still in continuous use”.

This content was published on December 21, 2009

Constructed around 1430, this unique instrument is the focal point of a Gothic organ festival that has been held each year for 40 years in Sion, capital of canton Valais."

'Contrary to what the uninitiated might think, gothic organ music can be very cheerful and is reminiscent of folk dances. The organist began by playing the “Music for Organum Antiquum, from the Robertsbridge Codex”, compiled between 1330 and 1448 and kept at the British Museum. According to Voeffray, this is possibly the world’s oldest preserved organ music. After this he went on to Spanish baroque music and concluded with a few 19th century folk dances. There’s no doubt that the historic instrument is a box of surprises despite its small keyboard.

And how do we know that the organ dates from 1430?

“From the murals in the church”, Patrick Elsig of the Valais Museum of History explained. “We know that they were commissioned in 1435 and the same person painted the decorations on this instrument. This fact, which is well documented, allowed us to date the organ accurately".

The wooden "hull" which looks like the prow of a ship (which you can see in the gallery accompanying this report) was added in 1630.

As Elsig explained, it should be emphasised that at that time an organ was “an almost inconceivable luxury”. This instrument would have been brought to Valère at the expense of Guillaume de Rarogne, a powerful figure who ended up as the bishop of Sion."

Played by Bishops in the time of Jost von Silenen!

William II Raron passed in 1417, before the arrival of Josse:

Regarding the organ, it is possible the music was inspirational to the composition of the Voynich manuscript- while not the first organ of its kind, 
the cheerful music would seem to reflect the mirthful quality of the penmanship- in the drawings, and as previously record, Jost von Silenen had breviaries made:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breviary

"A breviary (Latin: breviarium) is a liturgical book used in Christianity for praying the canonical hours, usually recited at seven fixed prayer times.[1][2]

Historically, different breviaries were used in the various parts of Christendom, such as Aberdeen Breviary,[3] Belleville Breviary, Stowe Breviary and Isabella Breviary, although eventually the Roman Breviary became the standard within the Roman Catholic Church (though it was later supplanted with the Liturgy of the Hours); in other Christian denominations such as the Lutheran Churches, different breviaries continue to be used, such as The Brotherhood Prayer Book.[4][5]"

Well, the Voynichese probably isn't an attempt at hymn/sheet music, but one can wonder: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymn#Western_church  

Edit: The  Master of the Breviary: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meister_des_Breviers_des_Jost_von_Silenen  

https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/de/list/one/psle/0003a

"The unknown miniaturist got his notname from his researcher Albert Jörger for his main work, a Latin breviary from 1493. This book of hours was provided with magnificent miniatures for the at times powerful diplomat and church prince Jost von Silenen (* 1435/1445, † 1498). has been kept in the Landesmuseum Zurich since 1899 .

Thirteen works can be attributed to this illuminator. His oldest dated work from 1488 is a Latin antiphonary ( Antiphonale ) with musical notes for the book owner Rudolph Stos (alias Roletus Stoss, frater OFM, fl. 1483/1500), now preserved in Friborg (Switzerland), Franciscan monastery (Cordeliers, library Ms. 6)."



I imagine it was more likely used to store more important diplomatic, historical foundings of Swiss Confederacy, and constitutional charters, him being a Prince-Bishop.

The base of these turrets/minarets get narrower, suggesting a metamorphosis into a plant, as part of the confederationization of Switzerland- they share roots or heads, but not both (at least at the same time?) THey also could be a hybrid of Swiss and Coptic/Islamic architecture

The topless towers appear somewhat like plants that haven' yet been uprooted. It suggests the plants are cut before they are pulled out and laid bare.

A comparison of the original, early three cantons (referred to as the "Growth"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76194453/229263574-e6801540-2cdc-4564-9849-98f1ad1b68e0.png)

There were 16 cantons by 1513 (Kaspar survived Jossse after 1498 and could have etched in the blackish (erase marks?) for Appenzell Innerrhoden, which, while they may not have been a member at the time of drawing, may have had sufficient promises (a loyalty oath for example- though it is something I will examine more) and no new ones until 1803: (update 4/1/23:  "Eidgenossen (literally: comrades by oath" from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland#Etymology suggests no written record of the earliest membership)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76194453/229264135-f3efc00f-ed44-49a3-acb7-a8500481550c.png)

The coat of arms color of Appernzell Innerrhoden is black, and, while not an unprecedented color- Berne, Uri, Friborg, Basel-Stadt, and Schaffhausen have half of their colors that, may have been added between 1513-1517, as the 16th blue flower (bulb) before Kaspar von Silenen died in 1517. It's clear none of the other cantons display any other colors, thus Blue would appear to be the unifying color of all the cantons, regardless of coat of arms differences (while common knowledge, I have not seen any Voynich theories before Dr. Gregor Bernhart-Königstein make this claim, although I am new to this and it is possible someone suggested it at some time. That said, viewing all of the information in this light/perspective could increase the possibility that this theory receives more consideration.

The green leafed branches also would appear to reference Suchy of Savoy, Suchy of Milan, Republic of Venice, Burgundy, Swabia (one branch could denote more than one Duchy.)

5 of the cantons were added after Jost von Silenen died from 1501-1513- thus their entry into the Confederacy may have been anticipated or known, considering there are minimal erasure marks on the upper blue "flowers"  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_(heraldry)

Etymologically I am going to look into whether canton has any floral origin- whether it refers to any bulb. If you have an OED subscription, please let me know what you find pre-1500. This is what I've been able to find:

https://www.etymonline.com/word/cant?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_677 

https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=canton

"cant (n.2)

"slope, slant," late 14c., first in Scottish writing and apparently meaning "edge, brink," a word of uncertain origin. "words identical in form and corresponding in sense are found in many languages, Teutonic, Slavonic, Romanic, Celtic" [OED]. It was rare in English before c. 1600. Meaning "slope, slanting or tilting position" is from 1847.

Perhaps via Old North French cant "corner" (itself perhaps via Middle Low German kante or Middle Dutch kant), from Vulgar Latin *canthus, from Latin cantus "iron tire of a wheel," which is possibly from a Celtic word meaning "rim of wheel, edge, brim" (compare Welsh cant "bordering of a circle, tire, edge," Breton cant "circle"). The ultimate connections of these are uncertain. Greek kanthos "corner of the eye," and Russian kutu "corner" sometimes are suggested, but there are difficulties (see Beekes)."

Iron tire of a wheel ^ canton bishops are represented as quarters of a wheel, there being 3-4 early on.

canton (n.)
1530s, "corner, angle," from French canton "angle, corner (of a room); piece, portion of a country" (13c.), from Italian (Lombard dialect) cantone "region," especially in the mountains, augmentative of Latin canto "section of a country," literally "corner" (see cant (n.2)).


From 1570s as a term in heraldry and flag descriptions. From c. 1600 as "a subdivision of a country;" applied to the sovereign states of the Swiss republic from 1610s.

While it is said that there were 13, I am currently reading why there are 16 listed. This research follows release early, release often philosophy:

because I prefer my ideas be reviewed as they are conceived rather than delaying what can quickly be corrected, if I am not entirely wrong.

these are the 5 cantons post 1498 and pre-1798 collapse:

(12) Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft are considered two different cantons, with capitals in Basel and Liestal. Similarly Appenzell-Ausserrhoden and Appenzell-Innerrhoden have two capitals- Herisau and Appenzell, suggesting their capitals may not have considered at one point different cantons (aspirational or not), thus including more bulbs was not necessarily a doctrine, but a strategy, as 16 capitals are listed, even though 13 cantons were in effect.

Valais Wikipedia article uploaded. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valais

Some important details, for Sion/Sitten, and (Jost/Josse): 

"In 1529, Valais became an associate member of the Swiss Confederation. After having resisted the Protestant Reformation and remained faithful to the Roman Catholic Church, it became a republic under the guidance of the prince-bishop of Sion in 1628. In 1815, Valais finally entered the Swiss Confederation as a canton. In 1878, the Simplon Railway connected most of Valais with the cities of the Swiss Plateau. The canton was further opened up by the Lötschberg Railway in 1913."

In 1400s Valais was fighting for this memebership, and the nature of the manuscript appears quite fierce in many regards- why would someone go to such lengths to protect the information, suggests that these notes protected the conspirators/patriots.

"By the late 14th century, the counts of Savoy acquired the bishopric of Sion. The Zenden resisted his attempts to gather both spiritual and secular power in the valley. In 1375–76, Zenden forces defeated the army of the house of La Tour-Chatillon, and in 1388 routed the forces of the bishop, the count, and his nobles at Visp. The German-speaking Zenden spread further into the valley. Starting in 1384 the Morge stream (a little below Sion) was recognized as the boundary between Savoyard, French-speaking Lower Valais and German-speaking episcopal Upper Valais.

During the Raron affair rebellion from 1414 to 1420, some cantons of the Swiss Confederation took sides in the conflict. Lucerne, Uri and Unterwalden supported the Upper Valais rebels, while Bern supported the noble Raron family. The uprising was successful in driving out the Rarons and almost brought the Confederation to civil war.[6]

Following the Raron affair, the canton was the location of the Valais witch trials between 1428 and 1447 in which at least 367 men and women were put to death. This event marks one of the earliest witch scares in late medieval Europe. The phenomenon later spread to other parts of the continent.


Earliest known map of Valais, drawn by Johannes Schalbetter in 1545.

Looking south, only the lower portion of the valley from Leuk to Saint-Maurice is depicted.

With the election of Walther von Supersax of Conches as bishop in 1457, the German-speaking part of the valley finally attained supremacy. At the outbreak of the Burgundian Wars in 1475, the bishop of Sion and the Zenden made a treaty with Bern. In November of the same year, they seized all Lower or Savoyard Valais up to Martigny. In March 1476, after the victory of Grandson, they advanced and captured St Maurice, Évian, Thonon and Monthey. They had to give up the last three districts in 1477 but won them again in 1536. In the treaty of Thonon in 1569, Monthey, Val-d'llliez, and Le Bouveret were permanently annexed to Valais. These conquered districts in the Lower Valais were ruled as subject lands by the bishop and the Tithings of the Upper Valais until 1798. On March 12, 1529, Valais became an associate member (Zugewandter Ort) of the Swiss Confederation.[5]"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valais_witch_trials

"The influence of the Valais on the much larger phenomenon of the witch trials in the early modern period, lasting throughout the 16th and 17th centuries in much of Western Europe, may have been amplified by the Council of Basel which took place during the same period, during 1431–1437. Here, theologians discussed the evidence for the new phenomenon of witchcraft and collected the court proceedings from the Valais, Vaud, and Savoy region. These documents were perused by the first generation of authors on witchcraft, such as Johannes Nider, the author of Formicarius (written 1436–1438).[12]"

The Ibex hunt suggests a reference to the earlier witch hunts, which Jost de Sion would have been aware of, having occured when he was less than 10 years old, but not necessarily a part of (he was born in Knussnacht)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76194453/229270145-32f882e4-5a4d-45b7-bc34-cdf2e0cfdcbf.png)


"Ibex (Capra ibex)
The Alpine ibex is a mountain goat instantly recognizable by the male's large scimitar-shaped horns which are ridged in the front. Females grow a pair of smaller, thinner horns which develop considerably more slowly than those of the male. The ibex ranges in height from 27 to 43 inches at the shoulder and weighs between 200 to 270 pounds. Ibex are related to domestic goats and will mate with other goats if they are unable to find a mate in the wild. Ibex were hunted to extinction in the early 19th century. By 1856 only 60 Alpine ibex remained on a royal hunting reserve in the Grand Paradiso region of Italy. Some of these ibex were smuggled into Switzerland around 1900 in an effort to reinstate ibex in the Swiss Alps. Under protection, there are now over 40,000 ibex in the Swiss Alps. Ibex are frequently sighted in the most rocky and wild regions of the Swiss Alps along the Haute Route, especially on the Sentier de Chamois in the Upper Val de Bagnes Nature Reserve, where they were reintroduced in 1926, and around the Col de Louvie and the Col de Prafleuri."

"The Swiss ibex live mainly in the high mountains of two southern regions (cantons) - Valais and Graubünden

Valais (also called Wallis) now includes foreigners in its strict quota of ibex hunting licences. But Graubünden (Grisons) only allows locals to hunt ibex."

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanton_Wallis

" King Rudolph III of Burgundy handed over the County of Valais with all rights and privileges to the Bishop of Sion in 999. From the second half of the 15th century until 1798, Valais was divided into seven tenths and was therefore also called the Republic of the Seven Tenths . This republic asserted its independence from the bishops of Sitten in the 16th century."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Florence

"The Council of Florence is the seventeenth ecumenical council recognized by the Catholic Church, held between 1431 and 1449. It was convoked as the Council of Basel by Pope Martin V shortly before his death in February 1431 and took place in the context of the Hussite Wars in Bohemia and the rise of the Ottoman Empire. At stake was the greater conflict between the conciliar movement and the principle of papal supremacy.

The Council entered a second phase after Emperor Sigismund's death in 1437. Pope Eugene IV translated the Council to Ferrara on 8 January 1438, where it became the Council of Ferrara and succeeded in drawing some of the Byzantine ambassadors who were in attendance at Basel to Italy. Some Council members rejected the papal decree and remained at Basel: this rump Council suspended Eugene, declared him a heretic, and then in November 1439 elected an antipope, Felix V.

After becoming the Council of Florence (having moved to avoid the plague in Ferrara), the Council concluded in 1445 after negotiating unions with the various eastern churches. This bridging of the Great Schism proved fleeting, but was a political coup for the papacy. In 1447, Sigismund's successor Frederick III commanded the city of Basel to expel the Council of Basel; the rump Council reconvened in Lausanne before dissolving itself in 1449."

While a cross is a very common figure, it's prominent and strong prominence on p. 16V suggests a veiled, but important assertion of Swiss patriotism, what would later metamorphose into its cross.

An alternate rendering of three cantons, with 2 on the main stem, suggesting imbalance and "weaker" from separated stems (though not top heavy) 

"slope, slant," late 14c., first in Scottish writing and apparently meaning "edge, brink," a word of uncertain origin. "words identical in form and corresponding in sense are found in many languages, Teutonic, Slavonic, Romanic, Celtic" [OED]. It was rare in English before c. 1600. Meaning "slope, slanting or tilting position" is from 1847."

Josse von Silenen grew up in Silenen, before becoming bishop of Sitten/Sion. Thus, as he was from one of the oldest families in the Uri province/region, he may have been referring to a castle using a design different from later iterations.

Changing gears, reviewing the machine translated German section of Dr. BernhartKonigstein's paper, as he covers the early Swiss history in detail, and I have not checked all the references, but I wanted to annotate names that I have not familiarized before:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76194453/229308326-d3079a0a-5aec-4dea-8265-4deb428e13ee.png)

by Schiller, he is referring to the early 1800s playwright, who wrote a famous story on Wilhelm Tell:

p. 5 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tell_(play)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schiller
"In September 2008, Schiller was voted by the audience of the TV channel Arte as the second most important playwright in Europe after William Shakespeare."

Codexes I imagine were common in the early Rennaissance, and I was reminded at times of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man (1490), who lived in the same time as von Silenen,  1452-1519, while on a different topic, but no less inspired:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76194453/229312124-71126e9b-9e6a-4ddb-811e-82ada27cfb91.png)

By the way, my upload early last week on the SIGBOVIC was written prior to my 3/28 Google Search on recent news or claims of the Voynich manuscript, subsequent discotvery of the OTS publication by the Austrian dr., thus I began my examination of the Swiss Bishop theory in earnest after that date. In the SIGBOVIC paper, I made a joke about the Rennaissance leading to inventions, one of which I said was the "winged man", which was a tongue in cheek reference to Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. So if I had led you on a goose hunt (on that detail), I didn't want to waste too much of your time as I too have redirected my efforts towards understanding more of the contemporary era's clues, which includes all aspects of medieval history- recent Counsel of Florence/Basel (1431-1449), the boundless mountain Ibex which were not yet extinct, and how religion was seriously viewed at the time. Thus, viewing these clues within the context of the era can help triangulate the location and increase probability of Dr. Dr. Gregor Bernhart-Königstein's claims being strongly correct.

Albin Meyer von Silenen is suggested to have ~~roots~~shrine/relics in Silenen: [39] Baker op.cit. pp. 212, 250
 p. 211 in Baker, E. P. (1938) "The Cult of St Alban at Cologne", in 'The Archaeological Journal' 94.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Alban#On_the_Continent
"On the Continent
There has also been an extensive cult of Saint Alban on the Continent from an early date such as in Mainz, Cologne and Basel on the Rhine as well as a number of other localities in Switzerland and Italy and a notable concentration in the French Alpine regions and the Rhone Valley.[36] Sometimes, the 'Saint Alban' concerned is regarded as a separate figure, other times, he is alternatively called Albinus (and often identified with 6th c. bishop, Saint Albinus of Angers), and at other times he is identified with the British martyr.


Stained-glass window in Lancaster Priory designed by Carl Almquist
Saint Pantaleon's Church, Cologne holds relics said to be those of the British martyr Alban (as noted above). In fact, although identified with the British martyr, he was locally known as Albinus. His relics were said to have been brought from Rome by Empress Theophanu and placed in St Pantaleon's church in about 984:[37] the relics were miraculously saved from destruction in an accident on the way at a place that a later version of 1502, was identified as Silenen, Switzerland.[38] The original record was in a 12th-century manuscript that alleged that the relics were actually those of the British martyr, having been delivered to Ravenna by Germanus himself and taken from there to Rome.[39] Another church at Cologne is known to have been dedicated to the British Alban from the 12th century.[40]

The Saint Alban of Basel is recorded in the Berne recension of the Martyrologium Hieronymianum of circa 800: "Basilea civitate sancti Albani martyris", where he would appear to be an independent local figure, being celebrated on 24 August but later identified with the Saint Alban of Mainz.[41]

St Alban of Mainz is recorded from 756.[42] He was regarded as a separate figure in sources from Raban Maur's early 9th century martyrology, including a 10th-century Life by Gozwin of 1060–2[43] However, Hippolyte Delehaye suggested that he very probably represents, in origin, a localised version of the British martyr since his feast date was recorded as June 21 in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum (just a day before that of the British one, who actually appears on the 21st and 22nd in early recensions).[44]

The story in Raban Maur associates Alban of Mainz with a martyred bishop, Aureus of Mainz and two other martyrs, Ursus and Theonestus[45] the latter of whom is said to have originated on the Greek island of Naxos, together with Alban. A Saint Alban of Burano (near Altino, Italy), meanwhile was associated with one Domenicus in a legendary tale reminiscent of one told about Dionysus.[46]"

While the shrine of Alban was temporarily on the continent (now in England), it is unlikely this is the same ancestor referred to, who existed 1000 years later. That said, it is mentioned of another local Alban:

"The Saint Alban of Basel is recorded in the Berne recension of the Martyrologium Hieronymianum of circa 800: "Basilea civitate sancti Albani martyris", where he would appear to be an independent local figure, being celebrated on 24 August but later identified with the Saint Alban of Mainz.[41]"

"Baker op.cit. p. 254; G.Allmang, 1366 in "Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Geographie Ecclesiastique", ed A . Baudrillart, Paris 1912; G.B. Villiger, 655 in Bibliotheca Sanctorum, Istituto Giovanni XXIII, Pontificale Universate Lateranense"

That was also 500 years prior, thus there is probably another Albin from 1300. I will examine the Rutli claim later" 
"The Rütli Oath (German: Rütlischwur, German pronunciation: [ˈryːtliˌʃvuːr]) is the legendary oath taken at the foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy (traditionally dated to 1307)" 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCtli_Oath

"The Rütli Oath is first mentioned in the White Book of Sarnen (written 1470, based on a source dated c. 1420).[1] The account in the White Book of Sarnen mentions how Beringer von Landenberg, the reeve of Unterwalden, ordered the confiscation of oxen from the farmer at Melchi (Sachseln). "

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Book_of_Sarnen 

"The White Book of Sarnen was composed in 1474 by a country scribe called Hans Schriber.[1]"

"The only surviving copy of the White Book of Sarnen, which was long believed to be lost, was accidentally discovered in 1856.[3] However, researchers disagree on whether the White Book of Sarnen, which is preserved in the public record office of the canton of Obwalden, is merely a copy of an older manuscript written around 1426.[4]"
"This second part, 25 pages in length, makes mention of the Rütli oath (German: Rütlischwur), the Burgenbruch, and William Tell’s heroic deeds.[1]"

The Deutsch version has a lot more information, and recently edited too:

https://github.com/hatonthecat/Voynich-Manuscript/blob/main/Guillaume%20d'Estouteville%20-%20Wikipedia.pdf

This Guillaume sounded like quite a teacher's pet, more loyal to Rome than his home of France:

"Bishop
The Bishop of Angers, Hardouin du Brueil, died on 18 January 1439.[14] Guillaume D'Estouteville, who was ambitious for the post, immediately rushed to Rome and obtained bulls from Pope Eugene IV on 20 February[15] naming him to the bishopric. '

"King Charles VII of France was angered at the interference of the Pope in French church affairs and threatened, in support of the Gallican church, to apply the Pragmatic Sanction and exclude the Pope's bulls.[16] Pope Eugene escaped from the danger by giving d'Estouteville the bishopric of Digne in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, a suffragan of Embrun.[17] "

"The Cardinal's hat probably softened the disappointment of losing the bishopric of Angers. Pope Eugene probably derived a bit of satisfaction at granting a red hat to a member of the French royalty without the request or consent of the King."

I should really quiet down when I complain of how long it takes to get a doctorate:
"He shortened the course leading to the Doctorate in theology from fifteen to fourteen years, and he removed the requirement that Doctors of Medicine be in holy orders.[32]" Denifle (1897), Chartularium IV, no. 2690, pp. 713-734.

Jost/Josse born around 1435, did not venture out to Rome to be mentored under Cardinal Estoutville until late 1469  (being ~34 years old, having been in Pavia since 1459 for 10 years and 24yro), after the latter's exoneration of Joan of Arc, thus he probably influenced Jost on his historical retelling of any Valais Witch trials symbolism in the Voynich Manuscript.

E. came to Lucerne as a baccalaureate and scribe and acquired citizenship in 1422. 1427 election as town clerk, 1452 resignation. Nurse to Franciscans. teacher. Ambassador to diets and foreign courts, especially to Milan. From 1458 on in the small council, E. served as council judge from 1458-59. Already during the Council of Basel he cultivated relationships with Veronese merchants, then in the interests of Klaus Stutzenberg, later Hans Irmis of Basel and other merchants also with the Duke of Milan. E. was one of the correspondents of the humanist Niklaus von Wyle. In 1431 he received the monopoly for writing letters of tenure, with which both the magistrate control of the notarial system and the income of the town clerk was secured. As the author of the "Silver Book" from 1433 (a magnificently designed cartulary from 1505 with an introductory section, translations of Latin documents and notes on the location of the documents), he initiated a reorganization of the Lucerne Chancellery's central accounting system. The introduction of double-entry bookkeeping based on the Italian model made it easier to keep track of the growing volume of state financial transactions and financial control over stewards and officials. For this administrative reform, Lucerne was forced to hold a daily council, administer an enlarged territory and as a federal To be able to serve office and suburb. The expansion of the law firm's activities made it possible for E. to train both his sons (Petermann) and people like Hans Fründ as chancellery clerks, which benefited their chronicling. It is disputed whether E. himself wrote a (lost) chronicle.

10:33PM Day's Summary

So as it may be apparent for any of my lurkers, this is a live, open-source crash course into early Swiss history- I am posting/live-blogging/micro-tweeting the snippets of information from any coincidental events during this period and region which I may find relevant. All this information is being researched in an improvised manner- very few assumptions are being made about "unrelated" cantons, as all regions, spanning from Western France, to Hapsburg, to Kingdoms of Italy are being examined- as Josse de Sion was a diplomat and travelled much of the lower continent, he certainly was well-rounded and exposed to many aspects of world-class events, placing no minor emphasis on any of his encounters or influences.

"Ancient historiography made the forest cantons the starting point and the nucleus of the Confederation. This vision persisted until very recently, helped to form the historical consciousness of the Swiss and became, in the form of a myth, an essential part of Swiss identity." https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/de/articles/007465/2014-12-27/
Well, true, but there's a lot more uncovered in this manuscript, apparently!

For reference, "The Tschachtlanchronik of 1470 is the oldest of the still existing Swiss illustrated chronicles, compiled by Bendicht Tschachtlan and Heinrich Dittlinger of Bern. The chronicle is now kept in Zentralbibliothek Zürich, where a facsimile can be viewed."

Thus even if Jost von Silenen was not aware of this book, it most certainly reflects what some of the towers and buildings looked like in his era.

The Zion & byzantine reference is quite similar to the Egyptian & turkish mosque idea- with Judaism and Gnosticism being hypothesized early last week (3/23 or so), but not as a Catholic source written.

The shape of this building  looks quite similar to the large square in the foldout: (p.226 of Berner Chronicle)

It could have been a convention, and economy to shrink three hills for single-page storytelling. Objects in rear may be closer than they appear.

"Isaiah 11
New International Version
The Branch From Jesse
11 A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse;
    from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.
2 The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—
    the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding,
    the Spirit of counsel and of might,
    the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord—
3 and he will delight in the fear of the Lord.

He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes,
    or decide by what he hears with his ears;
4 but with righteousness he will judge the needy,
    with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth.
He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth;
    with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.
5 Righteousness will be his belt
    and faithfulness the sash around his waist.

6 The wolf will live with the lamb,
    the leopard will lie down with the goat,
the calf and the lion and the yearling[a] together;
    and a little child will lead them.
7 The cow will feed with the bear,
    their young will lie down together,
    and the lion will eat straw like the ox.
8 The infant will play near the cobra’s den,
    and the young child will put its hand into the viper’s nest.
9 They will neither harm nor destroy
    on all my holy mountain,
for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord
    as the waters cover the sea.

10 In that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples; the nations will rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious. 11 In that day the Lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the surviving remnant of his people from Assyria, from Lower Egypt, from Upper Egypt, from Cush,[b] from Elam, from Babylonia,[c] from Hamath and from the islands of the Mediterranean.

12 He will raise a banner for the nations
    and gather the exiles of Israel;
he will assemble the scattered people of Judah
    from the four quarters of the earth.
13 Ephraim’s jealousy will vanish,
    and Judah’s enemies[d] will be destroyed;
Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah,
    nor Judah hostile toward Ephraim.
14 They will swoop down on the slopes of Philistia to the west;
    together they will plunder the people to the east.
They will subdue Edom and Moab,
    and the Ammonites will be subject to them.
15 The Lord will dry up
    the gulf of the Egyptian sea;
with a scorching wind he will sweep his hand
    over the Euphrates River.
He will break it up into seven streams
    so that anyone can cross over in sandals.
16 There will be a highway for the remnant of his people
    that is left from Assyria,
as there was for Israel
    when they came up from Egypt.

" Due to his incorrect behavior in the trial of Bishop Jost von Silinen from Lucerne, who was expelled from Valais by Der Matze, he was involved in a lengthy injury trial with the influential mayor Ludwig Seiler of Lucerne in 1496 and on May 18, 1498 for a long time, if not forever Time banned from the Lucerne area. R. , who first moved to Valais and then to Uri, tried to initiate a revision of the process in 1498 by arguing that he had accidentally put the documents in his favor instead of the files in his beret. When the Confederates' war against the German Empire broke out in 1499, R.under the banner of Uri as a simple mercenary on the field. On March 28, 1499 he was occupied at Rheineck. From there his comrades-in-arms, even Mayor Seiler, applied to the Council of Lucerne for a pardon for the impoverished, unfortunate knight. On July 20, 1499, Count Itelfritz von Zollern attacked Rheineck and R. was killed. The Diet honored the memory of the unfortunate by paying off the debts that R. had contracted in Rheineck during the war.

Deep in history and religion- the past couple days I was thinking, those who will first understand the story are of the faith, but I will not limit myself to that idea. That said, it would not be the first time that this attitude would be understood by only the truly pious.

"As an envoy of the Confederation, he stayed at the court of King Louis XI in 1472, among other things. and in 1474, on his behalf, made a significant contribution to the conclusion of the eternal direction between the Confederates and Duke Sigismund von Habsburg."

"He became a supporter of the French cause in Switzerland 1 . King Louis XI of France made him his delegate to the Swiss Confederation between 1473 and 1480 4 ."  from French wiki entry:  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jost_von_Silenen

Louis XI, who ruled from 1461-1483, probably tasked Jost von Silenen with some errands in Paris even if he was not in Paris himself when me met/appointed him.

It was mentioned that Jost von silenen employed an artist as well for his breviary, who was itinerant, thus the characters in the breviary may not have been drawn by the same person, considering the shape of the faces, as seen in the figure in the foreground on the left, with black and gold cap, has finer contours than the wide chiseled faces.

This also suggests an earlier rendering- Kaspar was born in 1467, thus he was only 20 years old in 1487, it is unlikely his drawing skills were as good as they were in 1493, at 26 and at 31:

Manuscript Summary:	Breviary in two volumes, created in 1493 for Jost von Silenen († 1498), the Bischop of Sion from 1482 until his dismissal in 1497. Richly decorated, the miniatures are the work of an itinerant artist active in Fribourg, Bern and Sion during the final decades of the 15th century and known by the name Master of the breviary of Jost von Silenen. At the beginning of the 16th century, he continued his work in Aosta and Ivrea, where he took the name Master of George of Challant. (ber)

" He participated in the Naples campaign of Charles VIII of France in 1494. He was reeve of Ebikon from 1497 to 1499, and member of the Lucerne city council from 1497 until 1503, when he was convicted of the illegal recruitment of mercenaries on behalf of France." 

Working theory:

So the 1st edition, released in 1493, was before his Naples campaign in 1494, thus he was at home in Lucerne or in the vicinity, visiting his uncle, who told him, "hey! can you draw these figures?" Then he returned to Lucerne in 1497, where his uncle was still alive, but had not yet fled to Lyon perhaps, and gave kaspar his books to complete, for both the breviary and the secret manuscript. By 1506 he was stationed in the Vatican as the 1st Swiss guard commander, and may have taken his books with him, but got stored in church repositories for some time until the purchase by Rudolph. As he died in Rimini, unexpectedly due to an ambush from his troops' hangover, it is unclear whether he secured the books ahead of time.

constructed 1610: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioteca_Civica_Gambalunga (no information suggests this library was a repository for Kaspar's secret manuscript, as it began construction 93 years prior his death. Picture was chosen for aesthetics.

Although, this location is quite an interesting place to begin a search:

"The collection holds 226,000 books, including 60,000 rare books (among which are 380 incunabula and nearly 5,000 16th-century editions), 1,350 codices, 6,000 prints, ca. 2,400 periodicals (330 current serials), music scores, cd-roms, audiocassettes, and films. An 11th-century Evangelarium and an early 12th-century codex of Honorius Augustodunensis and a codex by Hugh of Saint Victor are examples of the Beneventan script."

350 prior to 1500, and 5,000 16th century editions-perhaps some indicate more information on the records as to what Kaspar was carrying at the time of his ambush, and what possibly happened to his belongings? Assuming these records are not all digitized yet, it is possible that some of the records might have some information as to what books transferred, perhaps from a sale record.

5.The dragons of Mt.Pilatus– Mount Pilatus in the Lucerne region is a hotspot for tourists.However, interesting stories and legends stem from there. For instance, one legend says that dragons with healing powers lived in the crevices of the mountain. Another story also details how a young cooper was stuck on Mount Pilatus, but stayed safe in a dragon’s cave through the winter. A different legend also stems from the region, according to which, the body of Pontius Pilate was sunk in the Lake Oberalp on Mount Pilatus,after trying to sink the body in other rivers.The ghost of Pilate appeared to cause thunderstorms in the area. People believed that it rose every year on Good Friday, ‘to wash the blood of Christ from its hands’. He is said to  have ultimately found peace in Pilatus.

"In the early morning hours of 26 May 1499 there was a wondrous spectacle in Lucerne. After a terrible storm a gigantic, wingless dragon emerged from the tumultuous waters of the Reuss river near Spreuer bridge. The storm had probably caught the Lindworm by surprise and swept it from the Pilatus into Krienbach stream, which flows into the Reuss downriver of the Jesuit church. Several honorable and educated citizens vouched for the authenticity of this story."

This Legend coincides around the time that Kaspar was on the Lucerne council, and possibly in charge of the tourism department :)

"I’m going to tell you a story. The marvelous tale of Vietor, the cooper of Lucerne. His adventures are told in Kircher’s Mundus Subterraneus. Scheuchzer copies the story and adds the image you see above in his Itinera Alpina.

Vietor was a humble cooper (that is, he makes barrels) who lived in Lucerne around 1420. He set out one day to fetch wood on the slopes of Mount Pilatus, only to fall through a deep pit. The cave Vietor ended up had no exit save the one he fell in from, and the walls were too steep and dangerous to scale. Somehow this situation got even worse when two hideous dragons showed up!

Fortunately for Vietor, his prayers were answered and the dragons were not allowed to harm him (or maybe they were already harmless? The text makes it clear that it’s a miracle though). They weren’t much help either. The dragons spent their time sleeping or eating a sort of oozy liquid that came out of the rocks. Vietor followed their example. On this meager diet and in the slithery companionship of the dragons he survived from November 6 to April 10 – 6 months. On the last day the dragons took to the air to find greener fields, and Vietor held on to the second dragon’s tail as it took off.

Thus Vietor escaped his imprisonment in the cave and returned to Lucerne, where he had long been thought dead. But his liquid diet had ruined his digestive system, and he died two months later.

I bet you’re wondering what the dragon image has to do with all this. Well, before Vietor died he had the dragons and himself embroidered on a chasuble, which was presented to Saint Leodegarius’ Church in Lucerne. Scheuchzer reproduces the image of one of the dragons.

And that’s where Scheuchzer gets sassy about it, pointing out that it looks a lot like an imperial Chinese dragon. So what exactly happened? My guess is that a piece of far Eastern embroidery somehow ended up in Lucerne*, and the story of Vietor grew around that piece of cloth long after its origin was forgotten. At any rate all records of the event were destroyed in a fire.

*Now there’s an Indiana Jonesesque adventure plot if I’ve ever seen one.

Which just goes to prove how much cultural cross-pollination was constantly happening. Folklore and mythology doesn’t happen in a vacuum.

Vietor’s dragonscapades were also colorfully retold in Usborne’s Stories For Young Children by Christopher Rawson and Stephen Cartwright. It’s also where I first read the story, long before embarking on ABC. Here he has the more common name of Victor."


Kircher, who wrote Mundus Subterraneus book, is said to be one of the owners of the Voynich Manuscript:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76194453/229382847-1b9e6102-78ce-4b2f-9f08-0700ee7adea5.png)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundus_Subterraneus_(book) So does this mean there is a connection? Or that Kirchner added the dragons in the margins after the fact, having been aware of Lucerne's folklore? Or did he do his own research and later tell the story of the Pilates dragons, seeing Kaspar or Jost's dragon on page 1R? 
The full book is available at internet archive: PDF is 150MB, larger size formas avaialble:

For the time being, this information is being presented, without any claim to chronological order. It is merely acknowledging that Kirchner wrote about dragons in Mundus Subterraneus, whether from the Voynich Manuscript or other source.  In a sea of information, I can sort out the sequence (navigation) later.

p.18 by doctor, suggests they are initials- they look like V, dragon, and/or or serpent, esp the one on the top right of 1r and the bottom left of 1R

Also, based on the age of the red dragon ink, and even though I am not an expert, appear to be part of the text and not added later. i.e as an initial, or the technical word for a non-historiated (or obliquely historiated) letter  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial

I will return to the dragon later- somehow Kirchner knew of the Lucerne folklore- either by being able ot decipher the text, or having been told it from a previous owner. Basing it on the above information saying he tells a of a tale from Lucerne.

Switching gears, yesterday I located a Wikipedia entry mentioning Jost's father, Christian, and that he was the bailiff. As a note, not all wikipedia pages include all the information in each summary, thus toggling between the two and from external link sources reveals quite a bit. I had been curious of the Valais witch trials, and it now reveals p.20 how much of a role his father had:

"The town's first church dates from the 6th or 7th century and probably originated from a Roman building. This church was replaced in the 9th century by a larger building. It was replaced again in the 11th and 12th centuries. The romanesque bell tower of the current church is from this third building. The current church was built by Ulrich Ruffiner in the gothic style. It was richly furnished with altars and sculptures and was consecrated in 1494 as St. Stephan's Church by Bishop Jost von Silenen. "

It has taken me a while to figure out what tower it is in the center fold out, but I had not read the entire translation- it does appear to resemble Sforza castle much more:

Of course it is!

"German engraving from the 16th century, taken from the cabinet of M. Alfred Gérente." The main tower could have been damaged after the rendering, most likely, which would explain why the battlement is not conical and pointed

"The original construction was ordered by Galeazzo II Visconti, a local nobleman, in 1358 – c. 1370;[1] this castle was known as the Castello di Porta Giova (or Porta Zubia), from the name of a gate in walls located nearby.[2] It was built in the same area of the ancient Roman fortification of Castrum Portae Jovis, which served as castra pretoria when the city was the capital of the Roman Empire. It was enlarged by Galeazzo's successors, Gian Galeazzo, Giovanni Maria and Filippo Maria Visconti, until it became a square-plan castle with 200 m-long sides, four towers at the corners and up to 7-metre-thick (23 ft) walls.[2] The castle was the main residence in the city of its Visconti lords, and was destroyed by the short-lived Golden Ambrosian Republic which ousted them in 1447.

In 1450, Francesco Sforza, once he had shattered the republicans, began reconstruction of the castle to turn it into his princely residence. In 1452 he hired the sculptor and architect Filarete to design and decorate the central tower, which is still known as the Torre del Filarete. After Francesco's death, the construction was continued by his son Galeazzo Maria, under the architect Benedetto Ferrini. The decoration was executed by local painters. In 1476, during the regency of Bona of Savoy, the tower bearing her name was built."


though it is unclear if it was meant to conceal complete similarity:

Here is wearing a blue hat here, although it's unclear what is meant by the long tube-like hat in the Voynich drawing. It could be a ribbon of sorts.

I am still on page 32 of 42 of the machine translated German section (the first part) of the Doctor's summary. I can completely understand why he wrote the summary, as, if he began this research as early as 2020, I can see how long it could have taken to research all this, and, may have been also just recently cracked within a matter of months. In any case, tracking each reference takes quite a bit of time, and, I initially skimmed most of the material in my first read. I imagine completing the references from 32-42 will take me another day, and while I already skipped some, may return to those later, as I have just focused on the recognizeable clues and the more central events, such as the Rutli oath and the cantons' coat of arms. I plan to post more tomorrow but may post more tonight as well.

Background:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grisons 

"The Grisons (/ɡriːˈzɒ̃/,[3] French: [ɡʁizɔ̃]) or Graubünden (German: [ɡraʊˈbʏndn̩] (listen)),[note 1] more formally the Canton of the Grisons or the Canton of Graubünden,[4] is one of the twenty-six cantons of Switzerland. It has eleven regions, and its capital is Chur. The German name of the canton, Graubünden, translates as the "Grey Leagues", referring to the canton's origin in three local alliances, the Three Leagues. The other native names also refer to the Grey League: Grischùn in Sutsilvan, Grischun in the other forms of Romansh, and Grigioni in Italian. Rhaetia is the Latin name for the area. The Alpine ibex is the canton's heraldic symbol."

 Out of context, a missing letter would certainly throw off intelligible reading of Bruggs, the northern Swiss municipality in the canton of Aargau, prompting me to think of that Monty Python scene in the Quest for the Holy Grail, The Caves of Caerbannog where they read about "here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea he who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the castle of Aaargh...."

Congratulations to Gregor Bernhart-Königstein for finding this discovery, I am his first supporter! 

This is a project where fewer, to no search filters are going to help more than too many, because of the breadth of topics. I do not know how much of the Voynichese he has decoded, but this is certainly an example where individual disciplines are too overfitted for analysis. Unravelling this manuscript requires a constant play between metaphorical and literal meanings, and knowing the contemporary folklore of the 1400s.

In a way, since the industrial age (the 1800s onwards), we've all been a little overfitted! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting The specialization of labor has led to many lost knowledge, even if production gains improved: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour

And too, we have lost our geniuses and Rennaissance men. See this wonderful article by Erik Hoel: https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-we-stopped-making-einsteins

With the 100 years war ending in the 1450s, Valais witch trials, internal civil war in Switzerland, and Papal challenges, it is no surprise this thorny book made its way throughout the annals of history imperceptably to virtually everyone.

Jost had a difficult father, which doesn't mean he himself was destined to be the same, but the saying, "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/the_apple_does_not_fall_far_from_the_tree#:~:text=(file)-,Proverb,behavior%20and%20in%20physical%20characteristics."
probably had more meaning back then, with family ties being much stronger. That isn't to say Jost became a terrifying bailiff and Grand Inquisitor of Sion, but that he channeled much of his reaction to the history of Valais into his codexes.

Part of this was a struggle not only for his own survival, but the survival and establishment of the Swiss state!

I have added all the remaining available translations available from Google Translate- the original document has been translated into over 125 languages- all 133 or so and are in the Translations Folder. There are 61 language pages on for the Wikipedia entry on the Voynich Manuscript, thus it can be useful for those who do not have a native translation available yet. French, Spanish, and Italian translations are listed in the main directory.

A presentation by Lisa Fagin Davis from 2022 has been posted on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnaMRdBJ4U, and I referenced her early on in my 3/30 post ( https://github.com/hatonthecat/Voynich-Manuscript#3302023)  when I read Dr. Bernhart-Konigstein's mention of Kaspar von Silenen being suggested as one of the family scribes, along with Jost von Silenen (or according to Swiss archives, an intinerant master breviary. 

Interestingly, one Wikipedia entry suggests, Egloff Etterlin, secretary of Lucerne who also drew in the margins of his cartularies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egloff_Etterlin "It is uncertain whether Egloff himself was the author of a (lost) chronicle. Egloff died at some point between 1469 and 1477." Thus perhaps there are records of a different chronicle, unless

In many ways, Egloff and Jost had similar roles, as county clerks (and probably got bored at their desk jobs, thus resorted to doodling in their notebooks ; just kidding). 

https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/de/articles/014113/2005-11-22/ I really don't kow if Egloff had a role- he died in 1470, while Sitten was still in Rome, but he at least had an influence on the style or tradition in the Valais region, but this edit was made three years ago:

around the time Dr. Bernhart-Konigstein's Windows folder shows VV file modifications/creations (which also suggests he has been quietly at work on this for nearly 3 years): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76194453/229640022-0ca648fc-059c-47d1-a748-5e8f7e38fad2.png)

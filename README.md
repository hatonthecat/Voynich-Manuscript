Analysis, notes, resources, and theories about the unsolved Voynich Manuscript
----
Background
----
"The Voynich manuscript is an illustrated codex hand-written in an unknown script referred to as 'Voynichese'.[18] The vellum on which it is written has been carbon-dated to the early 15th century (1404–1438). Stylistic analysis indicates it may have been composed in Italy during the Italian Renaissance.[1][2] The origins, authorship, and purpose of the manuscript are debated. Hypotheses suggest that it is a script for a natural language or constructed language; an unread code, cypher, or other form of cryptography; or a meaningless hoax."

Approaches

Since there are many different theories, a list of some of the many theories will be analyzed. A comprehensive analysis would be needed, as several languages are used as substitution ciphers.

Some of the theories.

One person suggests the alphabet is "Bulgarian cirilic[cyrillic]":

"Voynich alphabet is Bulgarian, cirilic based.V.M.language is Middle Bulgarian hybrid. Hybrid part is Ottoman Turkish.Words shtovam,dyadov,harachi,yanyavar,spanak,varyavar can not be disputed. Who is going to be first to locate and confirm my findings. To help you out 8=V,9=E,2=R,C=S,X=H,4=SHT.The rest of the alphabet I am unable to type on this device. Thank you for your kind consideration. Sahbaz Bajrektarevic, peace."

Thank you for posting Mary’s clearly written book. Having excelled in cryptanalytics in the late 1950s , and freshly decoding Fibonacci’s 1292 AD ‘”Liber Abacl” 15 years ago, thanks to L.E Sigler, several number based attack approaches come to mind,:

First, infinite series problems were written by Fibonacci in finite arithmetic to
2-term and 3-term unit fraction series by subtracting LCM 1/m from n/p considered :

(n/p – 1/m) = (mn – p)/mn

1. 2-term series (mn – p) = 1

Example ( 3/11 – 1/4) = (12 – 11)/44 meant 3/11 = 1/4 + 1/44

2/ 3-term series subtracted a second LCM m

Example

(4/13 – 1/4) = (16 – 13)/52 = (3/52 – 1/18) = (54 – 52)/((18)(52)) = 1/468 meant

4/13 = 1/4 + 1/18 + 1/468

Encoding systems of this type date to 2050 BCE Egypt that scaled n/p by LCM m in a multiplication context such that

n/p x (m/m) = mn/mp

Found the Best divisors of mp that summed to mn …

created 2-term, 3-term, 4-term , and 5-term unit fraction series

Further encoding each numeral into Greek letters , Ionian or Doric, until 800 AD when Arabs ended the ciphered numeral step, and mentored Fibonacci to only write 2-term and 3-term series using numerals imported from India.

Bacon, Dee and other great medieval scholars, cryptographers , would have been aware of the older ciphered numeral to any available set of alphabetic characters … and used it to encode numeric data …hence minimal or virtually no actual language data may.be reported .

That is , only inventories may be reported, a type of message that also has been proven to be very difficult to break.

from Wikipedia:
" The first confirmed owner was Georg Baresch, a 17th-century alchemist from Prague. Baresch was apparently puzzled about this "Sphynx" that had been "taking up space uselessly in his library" for many years.[9] He learned that Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher from the Collegio Romano had published a Coptic (Egyptian) dictionary and claimed to have deciphered the Egyptian hieroglyphs; Baresch twice sent a sample copy of the script to Kircher in Rome, asking for clues. The 1639 letter from Baresch to Kircher is the earliest known mention of the manuscript to have been confirmed.[16]"

"In February this year, a paper published in the journal of the American Botanical Council said one of the plant drawings suggested a possible Mexican origin for the manuscript."

"He said he had managed to find the word for Taurus, alongside a picture of seven stars (seen as part of the zodiac constellation of Taurus) and the word Kantairon alongside a picture of the herb Centaury."

"Now, Bedfordshire University's Stephen Bax says he has deciphered 10 words, which could lead to more discoveries."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#Ciphers :
However, the presence of many tightly grouped shapes in the Voynich manuscript (such as "or", "ar", "ol", "al", "an", "ain", "aiin", "air", "aiir", "am", "ee", "eee", among others) does suggest that its cipher system may make use of a "verbose cipher", where single letters in a plaintext get enciphered into groups of fake letters. For example, the first two lines of page f15v (seen above) contain "oror or" and "or or oro r", which strongly resemble how Roman numerals such as "CCC" or "XXXX" would look if verbosely enciphered.[70]

The Catalan Wikipedia page for the Voynich Manuscript (translated using Google Translate)

"Statistical patterns 
The text consists of more than 170,000 characters, [20] with spaces dividing the text into approximately 35,000 groups of variable length, usually referred to as "words" or "words of words" (37,919); 8,114 of these words are considered unique "word types" . [21] The structure of these words seems to follow certain phonological or orthographic laws  ; for example, certain characters must appear in every word (like English vowels ), some characters never follow others, or some can be doubled or tripled, but others cannot.

The distribution of letters within words is also quite peculiar: some characters only occur at the beginning of a word, some only at the end, and some always in the middle section. [22] Professor Gonzalo Rubio, an expert on ancient languages ​​at Pennsylvania State University , stated: "the things we know as 'grammatical markers': things that usually occur at the beginning or end of words, such as 's "or" d "in our language, and which are used to express grammar, will never appear in the middle of "words" in the Voynich manuscript. This is unheard of for any Indo-European, Hungarian or Finnish language." [23] Many researchers have commented on the very regular structure of the words. [24]

The distribution of letters within the text is also strange. Stephan Vonfelt studied some statistical properties of the distribution of letters and their correlations (properties that can be loosely characterized as rhythmic resonance, alliteration, or assonance) and found that, in this sense, Voynichese is more similar to Chinese than to European languages, although the numerical differences between the Voynichès and the Chinese seem greater than those between the Chinese and European languages. [25]

Almost no word has fewer than two letters or more than ten. [20] Some words occur only in certain sections or on only a few pages; others occur throughout the manuscript. There are few repetitions among the thousand or more labels attached to the illustrations. There are cases where the same common word appears up to three times in a row [20] (see Zipf's law ). Words that differ by only one letter also repeat with unusual frequency, causing single-substitution alphabet decipherments to produce gibberish-like text"

"In 2014, a team led by Dr. Diego Amancio, from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Computing at the University of São Paulo, goespublish a paper detailing a study using statistical methods to analyze word relationships in text. Instead of trying to find meaning, Amancio's team used complex network modeling to look for connections and groups of words. Using concepts such as frequency and intermittency, which measure the occurrence and concentration of a term in the text, Amancio was able to discover the key words in the manuscript and create three-dimensional models of the text's structure and the frequencies of the words Their conclusion was that in 90% of cases, the Voynich systems are similar to those of other known books such as the Bible, indicating that the book is a real piece of text in a real language, and it's not good planned gibberish. [58]'

My Analysis
---

My first thought, after reading some of these ideas, was that to read the complete page on the Wikipedia entry on the Voynich Manuscript is to read all the 61 language pages it has been translated in, and hope that there is some information inferred or not incldued inthe other translations. That is, a computer AI did not automtically translate the 61 pages- those were coplted by Wikipedia volutneers. This is just the start of a resource, and ertainly there are many other places to begin, but it reflects more on the reader's biases to think only one language will have a better understanding. 

Thusm my theory is, what if the author of the Voynich Manuscript wanted to include other languages to intentionally require translators to understand other languages and not give preference to any specific one?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel#Themes

"The Tower of Babel (Hebrew: מִגְדַּל בָּבֶל‎, Mīgdal Bāḇel) narrative in Genesis 11:1–9 is an origin myth and parable meant to explain why the world's peoples speak different languages.[1][2][3][4]"
Themes
The story's theme of competition between God and humans appears elsewhere in Genesis, in the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.[13] The 1st-century Jewish interpretation found in Flavius Josephus explains the construction of the tower as a hubristic act of defiance against God ordered by the arrogant tyrant Nimrod. There have, however, been some contemporary challenges to this classical interpretation, with emphasis placed on the explicit motive of cultural and linguistic homogeneity mentioned in the narrative (v. 1, 4, 6).[14] This reading of the text sees God's actions not as a punishment for pride, but as an etiology of cultural differences, presenting Babel as the cradle of civilization."


I think that, if there was a need to encrypt a script (as it would be unlikely a language would use so many unique characters natively), it wold arise out of the need to hide a potentially persecutable belief, which could be an early religion, such as Judaism or Gnosticism.

If a language were banned, it would be a clear target. If a language was not banned, it would not have much of a threat in its era, at least. By writing a hard-to-decipher script, some possible value could be ascribed to it until a supposed Inquisitorial body could determine its affiliation. That is the pessimisstic view. 

The mundane view is that it is is a doodle notebook of a botanist who had an eye for natural biological architecture, which does not preclude the ability to have an interest in cipher/cryptography.

This was the Rennaissance, after all, when well-rounded scholars such as Leonardo Da Vinci were considered doctors, inventors, philosophers, things that could not be claimed with even a PhD and post-doc. The thesis approval process back then was non-existent, yet did not prevent great thinkers from influencing successful businessmen years ater. 

The Codex Leicester, for example, was purchased by Bill Gates in 1994, for $30.8 million (and is now worth $130 million). https://www.businessinsider.com/look-inside-the-codex-leicester-which-bill-gates-bought-for-30-million-2015-7#:~:text=In%201994%2C%20he%20purchased%20Leonardo,to%20select%20museums%20this%20summer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85YcMMhvvoQ (Though in many ways is worth more than that)

Good presentation https://github.com/joaoperfig/voynichstudies/blob/master/voynich.pdf : 

"There is not a single instance of a word being erased or corrected
(which suggests the book might be a copy) but some words have
been retouched"

This doesn't mean that a copy is a forgery, but rather that whoever wanted a copy - perhaps a king wanted an original, but the original was in such bad shape, or that there was something encoded in the original that he did not want left in. I prefer to start with the least plausible, so it should be relatively simple to examine more plausible reasons for making a copy. Photocopy machines didn't exist then, so would it be out of the ordinary to have no corrections? perhaps a wealthy buyer did not want any errors, and required his scribes to rewrite any pages that contained errors. Its not as if the pages had to be bounded before they were written.

Forgery Theory
---

"One of the most common tropes in the history of forgery is that of a rare book dealer "discovering" previously unknown manuscripts. Voynich is known to have had just this "magic" touch. He is also said to have acquired a large supply of vellum and to have used his knowledge of chemistry gained at the University of Moscow to replicate medieval inks and pigments. "

"But until forensic tests are done on the ink and pigments - so far, only the vellum has been carbon dated to the 15th Century - the riddle of this mysterious book will continue to exert a powerful magnetic pull on present and future Voynichologists."

Other thoughts:
--
To take a contrarian view, what suggestion is there that the manuscript must have any meaning? There could be multiple reasons why the manuscript cannot be decoded with just one language, or at all. Since the story of Babel is in Genesis, which is in the Old Testament (everything I learned from the Old Testament I learned from Lewis Black: https://www.facebook.com/beststandupcomedy/videos/658478987635564/ at 2:30), what if the inability to decode it is due to the unwillingness for different languages to cooperate? Short of holding hands and singing Kumbaya around the Tower of Babel, the Man in the Sky may not have wanted to signal any help in decoding this manuscript. Thus, this puzzle is like a punishment for those who spent their entire lives having never decoded it, unless everyone trying to decode it is doing something wrong (something other than trying to decode it, assuming it is not a fatal knowledge). One article suggests it is the "venus flytrap" of brilliant minds. I would think that, the original author could not have foreseen that it would take so long to decode because he or she lived in a completely different time, but one where different types of knowledge were not dismissed. Perhaps, it is our willfull ignorance in ancient ways of thought that would constrain the ability to contextualize the meaning. In many ways, the Rennaissance appears more of a utopia compared to the present. Perhaps not in medical technology, but in many other cultural ways.

Much Ado about Botany
--

Maybe no one is right if a higher order planted the truth in every language, so as not to give preference to any language, unless they all cooperated. An academic, and empath wouldn't need to believe in the same religion to understand why this manuscript was written, not is that relgion necessarily knowable, but to consider the context of the era, the manuscript could have been written to hide from heresy, but if it was the last in a language, then it might have been a translation attempt, or some pagan text. That said, it is not possible to rule out any particular subject, despite the obvious botanical and pharmacopeiac illustrations. I call it Much ado about Botany.

I wonder why some think it was written by Roger Bacon- the paper appears too "new" to have been from 1200s (but it's not much newer if it carbon dating suggests the 1400s). Another idea is, the original might not have had all the doodlings- what if the original author wrote mainly the text, but other artisans added more drawings later on? This wouldn't be unprecedented- large churches were built for continuous expansion- they were not built with one vision in mind- a new wind here, a new bell and tower later on- nothing suggests the book had to be written in one sitting- that said, it could have been continued by just a handful, as the scribes have been estimated to be 6 or less. It would be interesting if it were a book from Norse travels from NewFoundland (which could have taken tales all the way from South America) but I think that far less likely. Perhaps Marco Polo transcribed a phonetic account of a middle-eastern language. Any traveller since then could have too.

There are a lot of interesting theories that many of them can sound very plausible, but also the fact that many centuries have added to the obfuscatory nature of the any hidden etchings and re-transcribings adds to the complexity.

I find the fact that some words were found in High German from the early 13th century interesting (https://web.archive.org/web/20111018025101/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf), but also some parallels that are not particularly related but interesting nonetheless:

"Kalush and Sloman posit that the only reason Houdini would abruptly leave the United States in 1900, when he had finally achieved notoriety—and a paycheck equivalent to $45,000 a week—was because he was engaged in espionage. Houdini was rumored to be providing the German police with information about wanted criminals, as well as unspecified information to Scotland Yard Superintendent William Melville, monitoring anarchists in Russia, and helping the U.S. Secret Service with their anti-counterfeiting mission." from: https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/was-houdini-a-spy/

Melville also worked with Schlomo Rosenblum (Sidney Reilly): 

"In the next ten years, Melville embarked on a large series of well-publicized raids against anarchists. He went to Victoria Station to personally arrest bomber Théodule Meunier.[1] In 1896 Melville recruited Shlomo Rosenblum (later known as Sidney Reilly) as an informer in an organization he suspected to be involved with Russian anarchists.[1]" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Melville

Reilly was aquainted with Ethel Voynich, who was Wilfrid Voynich's last wife (from 1902-1930); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Reilly#The_Gadfly

Granted, anti-counterfeiting was probably a standard job duty of the Scotland Yard and something a bookseller like Wilfrid Voynich needed to be acquainted with to ensure he wasn't purchasing a fake manuscript, but whether or not the availability of 500-year old blank parchment paper would be plausible is certainly extraordinary but not impossible, thus a rare opportunity to fabricate text with gibberish (or at least a convenient way to delay decoding of a cipher by including alongside other ancient texts on a shelf). That said, the ink would also need to have been carbon dated that far back (presumably also a rare case of having been stored in a container for 500 years without evaporating).

from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#Early_history: 

"Marci's 1665/1666 cover letter to Kircher says that, according to his friend the late Raphael Mnishovsky, the book had once been bought by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia for 600 ducats (66.42 troy ounce actual gold weight, or 2.07 kg). (Mnishovsky had died in 1644, more than 20 years earlier, and the deal must have occurred before Rudolf's abdication in 1611, at least 55 years before Marci's letter. However, Karl Widemann sold books to Rudolf II in March 1599.)

Wellcome Library, oil
Ernest Board's portrayal of Bacon in his observatory at Merton College
According to the letter, Mnishovsky (but not necessarily Rudolf) speculated that the author was 13th-century Franciscan friar and polymath Roger Bacon.[6] Marci said that he was suspending judgment about this claim, but it was taken quite seriously by Wilfrid Voynich, who did his best to confirm it.[16] Voynich contemplated the possibility that the author was Albertus Magnus if not Roger Bacon.[63]


Mathematician John Dee may have sold the manuscript to Emperor Rudolf around 1600.
The assumption that Bacon was the author led Voynich to conclude that John Dee sold the manuscript to Rudolf. Dee was a mathematician and astrologer at the court of Queen Elizabeth I of England who was known to have owned a large collection of Bacon's manuscripts.


Edward Kelley might have created the manuscript as a fraud
Dee and his scrier (spirit medium) Edward Kelley lived in Bohemia for several years, where they had hoped to sell their services to the emperor. However, this sale seems quite unlikely, according to John Schuster, because Dee's meticulously kept diaries do not mention it.[16]

If Bacon did not create the Voynich manuscript, a supposed connection to Dee is much weakened. It was thought possible, prior to the carbon dating of the manuscript, that Dee or Kelley might have written it and spread the rumor that it was originally a work of Bacon's in the hopes of later selling it.[64]: 249 

Fabrication by Voynich
Some suspect Voynich of having fabricated the manuscript himself.[7] As an antique book dealer, he probably had the necessary knowledge and means, and a lost book by Roger Bacon would have been worth a fortune. Furthermore, Baresch's letter and Marci's letter only establish the existence of a manuscript, not that the Voynich manuscript is the same one mentioned. These letters could possibly have been the motivation for Voynich to fabricate the manuscript, assuming that he was aware of them. However, many consider the expert internal dating of the manuscript and the June 1999[52] discovery of Baresch's letter to Kircher as having eliminated this possibility.[7][16]

Eamon Duffy says that the radiocarbon dating of the parchment (or, more accurately, vellum) "effectively rules out any possibility that the manuscript is a post-medieval forgery", as the consistency of the pages indicates origin from a single source, and "it is inconceivable" that a quantity of unused parchment comprising "at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins" could have survived from the early 15th century.[27]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee

"Dee eventually left Elizabeth's service and went on a quest for additional knowledge in the deeper realms of the occult and supernatural. He aligned himself with several individuals who may have been charlatans, travelled through Europe and was accused of spying for the English crown. Upon his return to England, he found his home and library vandalised. He eventually returned to the Queen's service, but was turned away when she was succeeded by James I.
In 1583, Dee met the impoverished yet popular Polish nobleman Albert Łaski, who, after overstaying his welcome at court, invited Dee to accompany him back to Poland.[19] With some prompting by the "angels" (again through Kelley) and by dint of his worsening status at court, Dee decided to do so. He, Kelley and their families left in September 1583, but Łaski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country.[34] Dee and Kelley began a nomadic life in Central Europe, meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences, which Dee detailed in his diaries and almanacs.[32][33] They had audiences with Emperor Rudolf II in Prague Castle and King Stephen Báthory of Poland, whom they attempted to convince of the importance of angelic communication. The Bathory meeting took place at the Niepołomice Castle (near Kraków, then capital of Poland) and was later analysed by Polish historians (Ryszard Zieliński, Roman Żelewski, Roman Bugaj) and writers (Waldemar Łysiak).[citation needed] While Dee was generally seen as a man of deep knowledge, he was mistrusted for his connection with the English monarch, Elizabeth I, for whom some thought (and still do) that Dee was a spy." 

Ok, so it is known that John Dee associated himself with charlatans, and Voynich believed Dee sold it to Rudolf. That doesn't mean Dee sold Rudolf a forgery, nor would Voynich be interested in purchasing a forgery (had he somehow concluded that and that the manuscript still had value), but he was interested enough that ciphers were one of his other posession: :

"Voynich relocated his London bookshop to 175 Piccadilly in 1917.[12] Also in 1917, based on rumors, Voynich was investigated by the FBI, in relation to his possession of Bacon's cipher. The report also noted that he dealt with manuscripts from the 13th, 12th, and 11th centuries, and that the value of his books at the time was half a million dollars. However, the investigation did not reveal anything significant beyond the fact that he possessed a secret code nearly a thousand years old.[4]"

https://www.colinmackinnon.com/attachments/The_US_BOI_File_on_Voynich_p.pdf <-[4] As for "thousand", Francis Bacon developed the cipher in 1605 (400 years prior), so it is unclear whether the 57 page report refers to an earlier cipher, or that is incorrect. Unless it implies that he was merely not in posesssion of the "newer" Bacon cipher.

Book stores and antique stores are not all above selling counterfeits, at least in popular portrayal: 

"And then we learn that some of these antiques are more like "antiques." We never know how many of Childan's antiques are actually clever forgeries, which definitely connects these antiques to issues of deceit and uncertainty. Add to that the fact that some of these fakes are made by "Frank Frink," who is himself kind of a fake, since he changed his name and nose to survive. (It's like the paper writes itself.)

Now, Childan doesn't know about his "antiques," but Wyndam-Matson clearly knows, since many of them come from his store. W-M has his own idea about authenticity and historicity, which is that it's all in the eye of the beholder. So for him, fakes are as real as authentic antiques as long as the person thinks it's real."

Which isn't to say anything about legitimate stores, but definitely an exploitable trade.

5:23PM - A Matter of Two Bacons
---

Update: After reading 1/2way through I found the answer:

The BOI report is fascinating- Voynich's mention of a Bacon cipher briefly got mixed up for Francis Bacon's cipher, when the mentions in other documents that Voynich was unambiguously referring to Roger Bacon (p.15):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76194453/228381484-e248ee16-3c55-4551-a4b6-a96d724e9d9d.png)

On p. 22, The BOI leter further adds: "If he thought he could be of any service to the Department, it was only because it appears to be an excellent cipher, in as much as it has for several years defied the efforts of experts to decipher it, and he thought it might be, as it undoubtedly would, of value to the War Department to posess so valuable a system, but obviously it can not be placed at the disposal of the Government until we succeed in ascertaining what the system is.

If Mr. Voynich said that he was acquainted wiht the army cipher, he said nothing more than any non-military man could have said who had read the published statements to the effect that the army was using the cipher disc[overy?]. This has been a matter of common knowledge for many years)."

This does make me wonder, for someone who was able to acquire many manuscripts, that German castles weren't exactly garage sales like in the U.S., thus the availability of certain rare texts could have been made available through less honest and surreptitious means-visting estates, pretending to be distant family, etc.
